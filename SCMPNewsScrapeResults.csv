"Year of the Tiger: avoid March, September pitfalls as Hang Seng makes amends for a poor, defeated Ox...","Hong Kong stocks in for a roaring Year of the Tiger, Feng Shui Index shows","['Luck will smile on investors born in the years of the horse, rabbit, goat and pig, according to the tongue-in-cheek index compiled by CLSA', 'The Water Tiger signifies good prospects for industries related to shipping and cross-border trade']",Cheryl Heng,"Hong Kong-listed stocks are likely to scale the charts in the Year of the Tiger, making amends for a dodgy past 12 months. Luck will smile on investors born in the years of the horse, rabbit, goat and pig, according to the annual Feng Shui Index compiled by CLSA. The Hang Seng Index will get off to a roaring start when the new year based on the Chinese calendar kicks in from February 1, analysts Justin Chan and Stella Liu said at a briefing on Tuesday. March and September are potential pitfalls, they added. “The noble tiger will lead us on a journey of twists and turns that finishes on a high note,” they said. In the year of the Water Tiger , the lack of fire or metal presages a year of sudden changes. The Hang Seng’s lucky elements are fire and wood, so wood’s abundance in the Water Tiger’s destiny chart bodes well for Hong Kong’s market, they added. The Water Tiger signifies good prospects for industries related to shipping and cross-border trade, they said. The internet sector, however, may lose some of its shine. Its natural element being fire means investors should expect a “mediocre outlook.” “Since water is the star of the year, trade, shipping and travel should pick up, holding steady over the summer before pushing higher in winter,” CLSA said. “In contrast, metal is entirely absent this year, bringing challenges to the financial markets.” Year of the Tiger 2022: is your luck in or out? Zodiac sign predictions For fire-related industries such as technology and utilities, late spring to early summer looks to be the best period, the analysts said. The Feng Shui Index is a light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek assessment of the market based on the ancient Chinese system of harmonising individuals with their surroundings, without any fundamental valuation basis. The exercise, started in 1992, has produced hits and misses, including last year’s missteps. The city’s stock market has gained about 3 per cent so far this month, outpacing regional peers as speculation about policy easing in China gained momentum. The Hang Seng Index tumbled 14 per cent in the calendar year of 2021, the worst among major global indices. The Feng Shui Index had expected the benchmark index to peak in August and end the year higher , with pullbacks occurring in April and October. Instead, it peaked in February and crashed in July as China cracked down hard on technology companies, triggering a trillion-dollar rout . The Tiger occupies the third position in the Chinese animal horoscope, in a 12-year cycle. The Hang Seng Index finished higher in the recent tiger years of 1986 and 2010. It slumped in 1998 as a result of the Asian financial crisis.",2022-01-19T06:30:13+08:00,2022-01-18T18:37:00+08:00,2022-01-19T09:38:05+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/3163830/year-tiger-avoid-march-september-pitfalls-hang-seng-makes-amends,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/18/82e42293-4a5e-4176-8cf2-0b2ff0f693e9_8d361ae1.jpg?itok=ICooIsLk&v=1642502224,Markets
"SPAC backed by Chinese brokerage CMB International becomes first to file for Hong Kong listing, under new...",SPAC backed by Chinese brokerage is first to file for Hong Kong listing,"['A blank-cheque company formed by the asset management unit of Chinese brokerage CMB International has applied to list its shares', 'Acquila Acquisition Corp will look to buy companies in the new economy sector, and will sell to professional investors at HK$10 per share']",Georgina Lee,"A special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by the asset management arm of Chinese brokerage CMB International has applied to float its shares in Hong Kong, becoming the first to test a new listing regime which became effective this month. Acquila Acquisition Corp will offer shares at HK$10 each (US$1.28), it said in a heavily-redacted draft prospectus filed with the stock exchange on Monday. Other terms such as the number of shares to be issued and the timetable of the offering were not visible. The minimum lot size on the day of listing will be at least HK$1 million. Hong Kong is a latecomer to the SPAC frenzy, having only allowed them to list starting from this month. Unlike other countries such as the US, UK, and Singapore, that allow retail investors to buy SPACs , it will only permit professional investors to buy and trade shares issued by the blank-cheque companies. The city will only allow large SPACs that raise at least HK$1 billion (US$128 million) to list on its main board, the highest requirement among all exchanges. Aquila Acquisition Corp is looking to raise funds to buy companies in the “new economy sector”. “Our objective is to generate attractive returns for the shareholders by selecting a high-quality [acquisition] target,” it said in the prospectus. It warned that the past performance of the sponsor, CMB International Asset Management, cannot determine future returns. Also known as blank-cheque companies , SPACS have been one of the hottest fundraising trends globally since the beginning of 2020. They have no existing business but are vehicles created to raise financial war chests through a share sale to investors, using the proceeds to buy assets within a limited period of time. Investors tend to rely on the ability of the SPAC’s sponsor to identify an acquisition target and negotiate the terms of the transaction that will provide a return. In Hong Kong such an acquisition must be announced within 24 months of the SPAC’s listing date, and completed within 36 months, failing which the company must liquidate and return the funds to investors. Aquila Acquisition Corp said the new business acquisition is subject to shareholders’ approval, and that CMB International Asset Management will abstain from voting on the deal, as required by the Hong Kong listing rules. CMB International Asset Management is also subject to a 12-month lock-up period after the completion of the new business acquisition. Along with the new shares it will also issue warrants that give investors the right to redeem one share of the company each, which they can exercise 30 days after the completion of the acquisition. Morgan Stanley and CMB International are the joint global coordinators and bookrunners of the deal. CMB International Asset Management is wholly owned by CMB International, whose parent is China Merchants Bank.",2022-01-18T12:35:21+08:00,2022-01-18T12:35:13+08:00,2022-01-18T12:38:04+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3163778/spac-backed-chinese-brokerage-cmb-international-becomes,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/18/84e61d60-8723-4457-8469-9e0a8603aa72_d7a4b1cc.jpg?itok=YYSPOAJa&v=1642480515,Banking & Finance

The stock surged by the most in more than two decades. The family has agreed to buy 205.3 million shares from asset management group Seekers Capital Partners and other undisclosed sellers for HK$2.63 billion (US$337.5 million) or HK$12.80 per share, according to an exchange filing on Monday. The purchase will raise the family’s ownership in the hotel operator to 72.4 per cent from just under 60 per cent. The transaction is conditional on getting a waiver from the Securities and Futures Commission from making a takeover offer for the rest of the company by March 31, unless extended by both parties. The stock surged 19.5 per cent to HK$7.80 at the close of Monday trading, the most since a 21.7 per cent jump in February 1998. It earlier hit as high as HK$8.50. The stock traded at HK$6.65 on Friday, near a 14-month low, a deep discount to its tangible asset backing of HK$20-HK$24 per share over the past decade, according to Bloomberg data. Seekers Capital Partners, formerly known as Satinu Resources Group according to Webb-Site database , purchased most of its shares in the hotel operator from its 74.9 per cent-owned unit Tai United Holdings in a June 2018 transaction, also at HK$12.80 per share, according to past company filings.

It also owns a bunch of commercial properties.

China’s economy expanded 4 per cent in the fourth quarter last year , slowing from 4.9 per cent in the preceding three months, the statistics bureau said on Monday. That was stronger than the market consensus of 3.3 per cent among economists tracked by Bloomberg. “The below-trend growth has raised some concerns about China’s short-term economic stability, and an escalation in stimulus policies is highly anticipated,” said Zhu Chaoping, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. Further cuts to loan prime rates are among most possible moves, he added. Sands China soared 14.6 per cent and Galaxy Entertainment jumped 7 per cent, pacing a rally in gambling concessionaires.

"Stocks are a ‘falling knife’ without fundamental changes in China policy, regulatory and geopolitical risks...",Stock weakness may persist until China regulatory fog clears up: Natixis,"['Hang Seng Index logged a 3.9 per cent gain this week, the most in 14 months on tech rebound', 'Investors may be catching a falling knife as tech crackdown, distress among mainland developers and poor US-China ties are still playing out']",Cheryl Heng,"The rally in Hong Kong stocks in the early weeks of 2022 may flatter to deceive as the market remains a “falling knife” without fundamental changes in key policy and regulatory risks, according to French investment bank Natixis. Analysts led by Hong Kong-based Alicia Garcia Herrero and Gary Ng said the gloomy picture on local equities could persist in the first half, even as rival investment banks and global funds including Goldman Sachs and BlackRock have turned more positive on the outlook for Chinese stocks traded in the mainland and offshore markets. “Hong Kong’s equity market can still get worse before it gets better unless we see major changes in the current policy risk factors,” they said in a report to clients on Tuesday. “Investors have been busy rewriting the growth story of different sectors under the new regulatory normal, but the process is still on the way.” The Hang Seng Index advanced 3.9 per cent this week, the biggest gain in 14 months, following a rebound in Chinese tech stocks on valuations appeal, recouping more than US$200 billion in market value. The benchmark slumped 14 per cent in 2021, the worst performance among major global stock indices. China eased liquidity and borrowing costs last month and has pledged to prioritise efforts to stabilise growth since the economy lost momentum from mid-2021. Companies have also stepped up stock buy-backs to shore up prices, according to Bloomberg data. Yet, fundamental changes in the Chinese technology and property sectors and geopolitical tensions between the US and China are needed as evidence before any sustained turnaround. China’s metaverse: pioneer analyst picks 6 stocks to emulate Facebook, Roblox and other 2021 winners “Although IPO activities have flourished thanks to Chinese tech firms departing from the US, the sector as a whole is still facing tough headwinds from regulations, such as tougher antitrust rules, common prosperity and stricter data control,” Natixis added. “Developers are fighting for survival in front of the three red lines policy.” The analysts said some “milestone events” on the regulatory front changes, such as the resumption of initial public offerings by internet-platform companies like Ant Group, subsiding credit risk among Chinese developers, and better US-China ties, would help improve sentiment. China foiled Ant Group’s record-breaking stock offering in November 2020 in what is deemed as the start of its regulatory crackdown on the tech sector. The government introduced its “three red lines” policy against developers in August 2020 to rein in excessive debt and systemic risk in the financial system. Some traders are clinging onto hope that Hong Kong stocks could recover this month, pointing to a surge in company buy-backs and cheap valuations. Some 192 firms bought back a combined HK$72.1 billion (US$9.2 billion) worth of their own shares, the most since 2002, according to Bloomberg. “The surge in stock repurchasing activity indicates a bottoming phase in Hong Kong’s markets,” said Zhang Yidong, chief strategy analyst at Industrial Securities. “This month will mark a new dawn in Hong Kong market, with China’s goal to stabilise the economy being conducive for a rebound.” Jasmine Duan, an analyst at RBC Wealth Management, is also cautious, saying the bottom line on regulations has yet to emerge. Reports this week showed a slew of developers were still raising refinancing red flags. “Since the material deterioration of the property sector in October 2021, three months have passed without much meaningful action from the government,” she said in a note published on Thursday. While China’s overall macro policy stance will be neutral with an easing bias, “we do not expect a shift towards policy stimulus”.",2022-01-14T19:14:53+08:00,2022-01-14T19:13:14+08:00,2022-01-14T19:14:53+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/3163452/stocks-are-falling-knife-without-fundamental-changes-china-policy,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/14/be5751ef-c151-43c3-aa8f-310b5d5fcbc5_4c7cd46d.jpg?itok=oAQdPftE&v=1642158795,Markets

Still, the Hang Seng Index has risen about 3.9 per cent for the week, the most in about 14 months. “With the full-year earnings announcement coming up in March, it is likely analysts would cut target prices on several tech stocks, thus the momentum being much weaker than before despite the rebound,” Castor Pang Wai-sun, head of research at investment services firm Core Pacific-Yamaichi, said by phone. Alibaba slid 2.2 per cent to HK$129.30 after affiliate Ant Group failed to progress the sale of a stake in its consumer finance unit called Chongqing Ant to several parties including Cinda Asset Management.

Didi’s bankers have had preliminary discussions with the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) before submitting the A1 form to officially apply to list on the exchange, according to the sources, requesting anonymity for discussing a matter before its announcement. Depending on market conditions, the Beijing-based company may list in Hong Kong in the second quarter, the sources said, adding that the financial terms of the proposed listing are still being worked on. HKEX’s spokesman declined to comment on individual cases. Didi forced its way last June to a US$4.4 billion IPO in New York that defied injunctions by Chinese regulators, who later described the controversial listing as a “deliberate act of deceit .” The move set off a spate of retributions against Didi, forcing its smartphone application – the platform for drivers and passengers to interact – to be taken off app stores and setting off a series of cybersecurity investigations into the company’s use of customers’ data. In December, Didi said it would delist from New York and explore listing in Hong Kong. The company’s bankers are now busy finding a solution to ensure Didi meets all the listing requirements in Hong Kong, including the licensing of its drivers and other issues, the sources said. Didi will be a test to see if Hong Kong can step up as the alternative listing avenue for more than 200 Chinese companies that are currently listed on US exchanges, where they have come under increasing legislative scrutiny for everything from accounting standards to alleged ties to the Chinese military and US sanctions on Xinjiang . Hong Kong’s government and the local burse have rolled out the red carpet to welcome US-listed Chinese companies to raise capital, offering a series of incentives and regulatory reforms starting on January 1. “With mainland companies seeking to grow and still hoping to explore international financing in the face of increasing regulatory uncertainty in the US, it is likely that we will see more China concept stocks return from the overseas market,” Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said in a speech to the 15th Asian Financial Forum this week. “We are actively making preparations for that.” Didi’s listing would also be a big boost to the HKEX, whose IPO tally shrank 17 per cent in 2021, its first decline since 2017. Hong Kong was the world’s top IPO destination in seven of the previous 12 years. Didi’s capitalisation shrank to US$23.6 billion as of the close of trading on Tuesday in New York. Didi’s NYSE listing was handled by a syndicate of banks comprising Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan & Chase, Bank Of America, Barclays, China Renaissance, China International Capital Corporation (CICC), Citi, HSBC, UBS, and Guotai Junan. The Cyberspace Administration of China in July launched its investigation into Didi’s operations, which has yet to turn out an official conclusion. The investigators installed at Didi’s Beijing headquarters had not been seen in the last two months, according to employees.

A government report showed inflation in December was slower than expected, creating room for further policy easing.

China’s Shanghai Composite Index added 0.8 per cent. Alibaba, the owner of this newspaper, climbed 5.9 per cent while its health unit gained 3.7 per cent. JD.com jumped 11 per cent while Meituan climbed 9.1 per cent and NetEase strengthened 6.8 per cent. The rally has helped recouped US$137 billion of tech value since late Thursday. “The valuation of tech stocks like JD.com is not demanding,” said Stanley Chan, research director at Emperor Capital. “When market sentiment stabilises, funds that are underweight on such stocks will accumulate more.” Producer prices in China rose 10.3 per cent in December from a year earlier, compared to 12.9 per cent in November, the statistics bureau said on Wednesday. Consumer prices rose 1.5 per cent, versus 2.3 per cent in November. Both were slower than consensus among economists. “We expect the worst for growth in this downturn to take place in spring 2022, when the pain threshold will also likely be reached,” Nomura strategists said in their outlook report this month. “We do not view inflation as a barrier to Beijing launching more supportive policy easing and stimulus measures in 2022.” The State Council, China’s Cabinet, on Tuesday called for efforts to stabilise trade amid growing risks to economic growth. The government said earlier this week that it would boost investments in key national projects and domestic consumption. “China’s policy cycle is that of outright easing and will be the key driver to recovery,” Morgan Stanley said in a report published on Monday. Officials have affirmed they will continue to take action to stem the economic downturn, the report said. Elsewhere, CNOOC jumped 6.8 per cent in the stock’s biggest gain since February last year.

The Tech Index lost 0.1 per cent, while China’s Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.7 per cent. Alibaba Group Holding, the owner of this newspaper, fell 1.6 per cent while Xiaomi lost 1.9 per cent and NetEase slipped 0.4 per cent. The tech index had accumulated 5.5 per cent of gains since a late Thursday rebound, adding at least US$133 billion in value along the way. China’s tech sector faces a triple whammy in the form of weak consumer spending, slowing economic growth and tough regulatory pressures in 2022, Felix Liu, an analyst at UBS Securities said. Odds of sharp earnings contraction in the next 12 months are as high as 70 per cent , according to BCA Research. “It is still early to tell if this round of gains are here to stay as the recovery remains concentrated in weaker stocks,” said Stanley Chik, research director at BrightSmart Securities, said in a note on Tuesday. “Continued Covid-19 outbreaks in Hong Kong and mainland China also add to economic pressures.” Hong Kong is battling an Covid-19 outbreak of late involving the more transmissive variant, with 24 cases confirmed Monday, five of them local. In mainland China, an outbreak in Xian has necessitated weeks of lockdown while new cases emerged in southern Guangdong province. Alibaba dragged down the index as its chairman and group CEO Daniel Zhang resigned from the board of Weibo on Monday, according to an exchange filing, replaced by chief marketing officer Pen Hung Tung. Alibaba has sold some of its media interests in recent months, including the Mango TV network. Besides, analysts at Citigroup, Nomura, Daiwa Capital, Benchmark and Atlantic Equities have trimmed their price targets for Alibaba’s Hong Kong and US-listed shares over the past month, according to Bloomberg data.

Hang Seng Index’s members have been trading below their average book value for 21 straight days. The tech gauge’s price-to-book ratio of 1.36 times is near its record low of 1.29 times set on December 29. A late rally in tech stocks lifted the Hang Seng Index to a 0.4 per cent gain last week. That made it a sixth consecutive year in which the benchmark had a winning start to a new year. HSBC jumped 3.2 per cent after earlier hitting the highest level since March 2021, tracking the stock’s rally in London on late Friday.

Huitongda, in which Alibaba (China) Network Tech holds a 19.1 per cent stake, is aiming to raise between US$500 million and US$1 billion, according to these people, who asked not to be named because they are not authorised to speak publicly about the deal. Network Tech is a subsidiary of Alibaba Group Holding, which owns the South China Morning Post . If the pre-marketing goes smoothly, Huitongda is targeting to proceed with the IPO’s book building process later this month, although the timing could still change as a share sale is subject to prevailing market conditions, these people said. Alibaba tops Greenpeace China e-commerce ranking for climate commitments Last year, the Hang Seng Index fell 14 per cent , making Hong Kong the worst-performing market out of 92 major indexes tracked by Bloomberg. Investors’ appetite for IPOs was dampened by the stocks’ post-trading debut performance , as 70 per cent of the 96 listings in Hong Kong were trading below their offering price by December 31. This came as Hong Kong also lost its 2020 ranking as the world’s second-biggest IPO venue last year, as Beijing started undertaking a range of regulatory reforms in July to crack down on technology companies and private tutoring businesses. This, together with a wave of reforms proposed to counter cybersecurity risks and bolster data security, have dried up new listings, particularly during the last quarter. A successful listing by Huitongda could test investors’ appetite for IPOs and usher in this year’s first sizeable deal after China’s artificial intelligence giant SenseTime successfully raised HK$6.64 billion (US$851.4 million) last month. With more than 60,000 active users and nearly 5,000 suppliers, the Nanjing-based firm sells six categories of merchandise ranging from auto parts, agricultural production gear, liquor, household appliances and homebuilding materials. In 2017, it also launched a software-as-a-service business that provides merchants on its platform with retail management, online storefront and data analytics solutions. For the nine months ended September, Huitongda booked a net loss of 157.9 million yuan (US$24.7 million), narrowing from a net loss of 306.2 million yuan, according to its preliminary prospectus filed to the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) last month. Total retail sales of consumer durables and agricultural equipment in China’s lower-tier market are expected to grow to 7.3 trillion yuan in 2025, from 4.7 trillion yuan in 2020, according to Frost & Sullivan’s estimates cited in Huitongda’s prospectus. Huitongda plans to use the net proceeds to expand its customer base, further digitalising its internal information technology systems and enhancing its data analytics capabilities, along with expanding its headcount.

The start-up, which is formally known as Shanghai Lantu Information Technology Holding Ltd, is working with China International Capital Corp and Goldman Sachs on the offering that could raise US$300 million to US$400 million this year, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Deliberations are ongoing, and details such as timing and size could change, the people said. Representatives for Tuhu said they weren’t aware of a listing plan. Goldman Sachs and CICC declined to comment. Hong Kong IPOs exempted from finalised cybersecurity rules, analysts say Tuhu joins a slew of Chinese companies that are choosing to list in the Asian financial hub instead of the US after Beijing cracked down on overseas listings over data security concerns and American regulators started pushing for better risk disclosures. Lalamove , a logistics firm, and Meicai , which connects restaurants with vegetable producers, are among those re-routing their IPOs to Hong Kong, Bloomberg News has reported. Started in Shanghai in 2011, Tuhu has become one of the major players in China’s highly fragmented automotive aftermarket sector. Its online platform offers services such as tire and battery replacement, as well as refurbishment, according to its website. In an interview last year, founder Chen Min expected 2021 revenue to jump at least 50 per cent from 10 billion yuan (US$1.6 billion) in the previous 12 months. Tuhu raised US$450 million in 2018 in a funding round led by investors including Tencent, Carlyle Group Inc and Sequoia Capital, according to a company statement.

China stock rout not just about tech crackdown as earnings model shows 70 per cent odds of sharp contraction,China stock rout not only about crackdown given high odds of earnings dent,"['Earnings model shows 70 per cent chance of a significant contraction in the coming 12 months: BCA Research', 'Stocks may see a tactical bounce in the next two to three months on policy stimulus bets, but a legitimate improvement in fundamentals is needed for an upgrade call']",Cheryl Heng,"More than US$97 billion of value in offshore Chinese tech stocks has been erased in the opening three days of 2022 in Hong Kong’s market worst start to a year since 2005. Investors banking on a swift turnaround should heed at least two warning signs. While regulatory and geopolitical risks continue to haunt, the market also faces another negative factor in the form of earnings setback as growth in the world’s second-largest economy decelerates, according to BCA Research. The odds of a significant earnings contraction over the coming 12 months are as high as 70 per cent, according to a model run by the Montreal-based research firm. The model has successfully warned of the three major contractions over the past decade, it said. “In previous cycles, stocks only bottomed when the earnings adjustment process was well under way,” China investment strategist Sima Jing wrote in a report to clients on January 6. “This adjustment process has barely begun in the current cycle, which argues against a cyclically overweight stance towards Chinese stocks.” The Chinese economy offered mixed recovery signals, deterring any move to upgrade its market recommendations, BCA Research said. While the official PMI and high-frequency, market-based growth indicator improved slightly in December, the underlying sub-indices were weak. New orders and business activity in the construction sector fell sharply due to sluggish infrastructure and housing drag, it added. China International Capital Corp, the nation’s biggest investment bank, trimmed its gross domestic product growth forecast for 2022 to 4.1 per cent from 4.5 per cent, according to its report on January 4. Stocks sank earlier this week, a rebuff to investors who deemed the sell-off in 2021 as excessive, as Tencent Holdings’ divestment plans spooked investors. Investors suffered a US$1.1 trillion wipeout in 2021 as the Hang Seng Tech Index and the Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index crashed, largely due to persistent regulatory crackdowns. “Given that the regulatory environment is changing, I’m not surprised that a lot of companies are rethinking how to deploy their assets, or realise their investments,” said Hyde Chen, managing director and head of investment strategy at Haitong International Asset Management in Hong Kong. “That could be the trend. Investors expect that, as we see some other tech stocks having meaningful corrections.” That will certainly bring more volatility to the market, Chen said, adding that sentiment or confidence is fragile and investors are prone to “sell first and ask questions later”. Still, China’s efforts to stabilise growth could possibly induce a tactical rebound in stocks in the next two to three months as investors welcome signs of policy-easing signals. The central bank cut banks’ reserve-requirement ratio last month, while a benchmark borrowing cost fell for the first time in 20 months. “The People’s Bank of China will contribute to the efforts to safeguard growth with further monetary easing,” Chi Lo, senior market strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said in a note to clients on Tuesday. Local governments will lean towards pro-growth policies as they are now a political priority, he added. Yet, BCA Research is sceptical because the current policy support does not go far enough to revive China’s economy and it is doubtful that policymakers will provide aggressive stimulus and allow a major acceleration in credit growth in 2022. Regulatory and geopolitical risks remain a major challenge for Chinese companies listed in the offshore equity markets, BCA Research said. Big tech names still face regulatory pressures, after new fines on Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent units this week. Beijing has also further tightened its scrutiny of overseas stock offerings involving sensitive industries. The ongoing US-China disputes are “deep and structural” and will likely culminate in the months leading up to the 20th National Party Congress in China, and the midterm election in the US in the fall of 2022, BCA Research said.",2022-01-07T08:30:14+08:00,2022-01-06T18:20:08+08:00,2022-01-07T15:34:17+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3162394/china-stock-rout-not-just-about-tech-crackdown-earnings,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/07/388717ea-2424-40b3-8f92-a297c07599dd_2cb0230f.jpg?itok=jsAxrDUi&v=1641540859,China Business
"China exempts Hong Kong listings from finalised cybersecurity review rules for offshore IPOs, analysts say","Hong Kong IPOs exempted from finalised cybersecurity rules, analysts say","['Internet platforms operators with more than 1 million users in China must go through a cybersecurity review before they apply to foreign regulators to list', 'The rules make no mention of Hong Kong, a region that is not considered a foreign authority under China’s ‘one country two systems’ governance arrangement']",Xinmei Shen,"China’s regulators will exempt Hong Kong from the rigid cybersecurity review process for all initial public offerings (IPOs) in foreign markets by companies with the personal data of at least 1 million customers, according to analysts’ reading of the finalised regulations published on Tuesday. Internet platforms operators with more than 1 million users in China must go through a cybersecurity review before they apply to “foreign” regulators to raise funds through IPOs, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said. The regulation did not mention Hong Kong, a special administrative region (SAR) that is not considered a “foreign” authority under China’s “one country, two systems” governance arrangement. That means IPOs by Chinese technology companies will be exempted from the review, according to an article on the Chinese blog Xiaobei Talks Security , a cybersecurity policy-themed blog started by a group of cybersecurity lawyers and scholars. “The policy is clear now; the document only proposed requirements for IPOs in foreign markets without mentioning Hong Kong, which means cybersecurity reviews are not required for companies going public in Hong Kong,” according to the article. What does Didi’s probe mean for the industry and China’s tech giants? The new review regulation was approved by China’s State Council and is backed by 13 government ministries, including the CAC, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of State Security, as well as the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). Still, a separate draft by the CAC in November 2021 cited national security reasons for a cybersecurity check on “data-processing entities seeking a listing in Hong Kong that will influence or may influence national security.” The draft is still being studied and may be amended in the final version in light of the cybersecurity review. Bruce Pang, head of strategy and macro research at China Renaissance Securities, said the door is still open for Beijing to impose cybersecurity review on listings in Hong Kong if it chooses to. “There are no legal or procedural obstacles for the relevant authorities in China to initiate a cybersecurity review into companies with plans to go public in Hong Kong,” Pang wrote. “In practice, the probability [still] remains relatively high for cybersecurity reviews to apply to companies that are seeking a listing in Hong Kong.” The first cybersecurity review was launched last July following probes into Didi Global’s US$4.4 billion New York IPO, which defied injunctions by Chinese authorities . It roiled markets in Hong Kong and New York, forcing the CSRC, which was not involved in the probe into Didi, to assure investors that China still supports fundraising by its companies in overseas markets. Can 'Made In China 2025' turn the country into a world leader in tech? Nevertheless, the uncertainties and ambiguities surrounding the additional requirement have contributed to a wave of businesses opting for IPOs in Hong Kong instead of the US, a traditionally more attractive capital market for Chinese companies. Three scenarios apply for overseas listings, under the cybersecurity review regulations. The first scenario involves companies that do not require any cybersecurity review. The second applies to companies whose IPOs are deemed not detrimental to national security and are therefore cleared for foreign IPOs. The final scenario forbids companies from listing in foreign markets if their IPOs are deemed to affect national security, CAC said. The security review office is positioned with the CAC, although the specific procedural work such as the acceptance of applications and the handling of documents fall under the China Cybersecurity Review Technology and Certification Centre, a unit affiliated with the antitrust watchdog agency the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR).",2022-01-04T13:58:03+08:00,2022-01-04T13:57:56+08:00,2022-01-04T22:02:07+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3162050/china-exempts-hong-kong-listings-cybersecurity-review-regulators,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/04/2dcfdc6a-1e3f-4590-8a78-46cb94bf0d76_60139db3.jpg?itok=sz16cyjn&v=1641275877,Policy

The CSI300, which tracks the biggest stocks in Shenzhen and Shanghai, declined 0.5 per cent, mirroring opening-day setbacks in 2019, 2016, 2014 and 2012. China will put into effect on February 15 measures specifying circumstances that affect or may affect national security by network platform operators’ data processing activities, according to a statement on Tuesday. “Sentiment remains cautious as the draconian policies on internet companies are not quite finished yet” on top of property-market concerns, said Louis Tse Ming-kwong, managing director at Wealthy Securities. “The first quarter is mainly a consolidation phase.” The cybersecurity review measures, covering operators with personal information of at least 1 million users, followed a regulatory clampdown and China’s decision to haul up Didi Global days after its US$4.4 billion stock offering last June for potential breaches. The ride-hailing firm is now seeking to delist from New York. Still, the new measures were s ilent on tech listings in Hong Kong , suggesting the cybersecurity oversight would exempt IPOs in the city, analysts said. The Hang Seng benchmark earlier gained on a private report that showed factory activity in mainland China grew at the fastest pace in six months in December. Robust sales of vehicles also underpinned a rally in auto stocks. BYD jumped 2.8 per cent after sales in December surged 76 per cent from a year earlier.

Chinese offshore stocks to turn corner in 2022 even as Xi’s ‘common prosperity’ goal and regulatory...,"Chinese offshore stocks to turn corner in 2022, global funds say","['China may outperform other markets in 2022, Fidelity executive says', 'We recognise the regulatory risks, ‘yet see current valuations as offering eligible investors adequate compensation for them’, Blackrock’s chief China economist says']",Cheryl Heng,"2021 was a tumultuous year for Chinese offshore stocks, amid regulatory action by Beijing that led to deep losses on the Hang Seng Index and US-listed Chinese companies . But the market could turn a corner in the new year, global funds said. “China may outperform other markets in 2022, given its easing cycle has already started. Valuations are more reasonable , and there is still low ownership among global investors,” said Jing Ning, portfolio manager for Fidelity’s China Focus Fund in a 2022 outlook note on December 7. Here is what could lie ahead for investors and markets in 2022. Common prosperity Investors will be well aware of President Xi Jinping’s “common prosperity” goal , following a US$5.2 trillion sell-off last year in the MSCI China Index, a gauge of 741 companies with mainland Chinese operations. Analysts, however, said that the goal was clear and consistent. Its top priorities are debt reduction and a narrowing of income disparity, Louisa Lo, China fund manager at Schroders, said in an outlook report on December 15. “The policies can be fine-tuned if necessary, but will not be reversed, as a long-term shift in economic drivers and derisking are still the focus of policymakers,” she said. China’s policy shift to boost growth in 2022 puts consumer stocks in play The resulting crackdown aims to steer China towards a more consumption-driven economy, said Ken Peng, head of Asia-Pacific investment strategy at Citi Global Wealth Investments. That will bolster the growth of China’s middle classes, which are expected to increase by 150 million in the coming decade, he said in a report published in December. China’s stressed property sector, for instance, was a case in point, he said. While Beijing’s tightened scrutiny of property developers had led to defaults, it would benefit consumers. “The flipside is the liberation of savings that were stashed away to invest in property. These could be spent on greater consumption,” he said. China’s economy But the immediate effect of the common prosperity goal was to slow down China’s economy, which softened throughout 2021. It was further exacerbated by Covid-19 outbreaks, cooling property markets, power shortages and slowing exports, sending markets into bear territory. This slowdown has led to many betting on policy easing, on Beijing loosening monetary and financial measures to shore up the economy. Signs have emerged, as the People’s Bank of China freed up liquidity for lenders last month. “China’s market valuations appear to be near the floor and should be well-supported from here,” Manraj Sekhon, chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton emerging-markets equity, said in a note on December 15. “While near-term headwinds from regulatory uncertainty and China’s ‘zero-Covid-19’ stance could extend into 2022, policymakers stand ready to stabilise economic growth if needed.” As with the rest of the world, China is adjusting to structural inflation, as the cost of goods leaving China’s factories surged by a decade-high last year. That could peak in 2022, as supply chains improve, said Schroders’ Lo. “2022 could be a better year for high-quality consumer stocks … [as those] with strong brand power may be able to pass through high input costs to end-consumers amid a better consumption environment.” What lies ahead Global asset managers see green energy among the bright spots in the market, amid China’s push for carbon-neutrality by 2060. Among the top 10 performing stocks on the CSI300 Index in 2021 were Trina Solar, JA Solar Technology and Huaneng Power International. Chinese electric carmaker BYD was among the best performers last year on the battered Hang Seng Index, with a 31 per cent jump. Energy transition, electric vehicles and high‑performing computing are major trends for China in the next five to 20 years, said Zheng Wenli, who manages the China Evolution Equity portfolio at T Rowe Price. A prominent downside is that regulatory overhang may persist. “Regulatory uncertainty could continue. We believe that the recent regulatory changes are partly a function of China’s political cycle, which is likely to culminate in the 20th National Congress,” said Franklin Templeton’s Sekhon. The 20th National Party Congress, China’s main political event this year, will take place in October and could bring clarity to markets on reform direction. Other global asset managers such as BlackRock Investment Institute remained positive about Chinese equities despite the regulatory uncertainty. “We recognise the [regulatory] risks, yet see current valuations as offering eligible investors adequate compensation for them,” Yu Song, Blackrock’s chief China economist, said in a 2022 outlook report published last month. “We stay moderately positive on Chinese equities as we see a shift to a slightly easier policy. We expect the regulatory clampdown to last but not intensify.” Another major domestic risk was China’s zero-Covid strategy. The country has continued to impose strict restrictions even as a growing number of countries turn away from lockdowns, as seen from authorities sealing off Xian amid its latest outbreak. “Periodic lockdowns against even small flare-ups of infections have come at great cost to the economy, inhibiting consumption and services recoveries,” Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers, said on December 15. “The more frequently such restrictions are imposed, the greater the risk that the domestic recovery is permanently impaired,” he said.",2022-01-04T07:30:29+08:00,2022-01-03T15:31:05+08:00,2022-01-04T12:59:18+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3161935/chinese-offshore-stocks-turn-corner-2022-even-xis-common,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/03/c6df02e1-2ba5-438e-9cd0-f782cd84154e_4cca5d27.jpg?itok=zWZxKWp2&v=1641195067,China Business

Limiting losses, carmakers advanced on robust December sales. The Hang Seng Index slipped 0.5 per cent to 23,274.75 at the close of Monday’s session, following a 0.8 per cent gain in the final week of trading in 2021. It was only the third time in the past 10 years that the benchmark fell on the opening day of trading, after setbacks in 2019 and 2016. The Hang Seng Tech Index dropped 0.5 per cent, with Alibaba Group Holding and its health information unit retreating by at least 3.3 per cent. Markets in mainland China were shut for a public holiday. Shenzhou International plunged 7.8 per cent, leading index losers, after the Chinese garment manufacturer reported Covid-19 cases among its employees. Its factories in Ningbo, in eastern province of Zhejiang, were locked down after the firm reported 10 Covid-19 cases since Sunday, it said in a filing. “The developments of the Covid-19 pandemic remains as a big uncertainty,” Stanley Chik, research director at BrightSmart Securities, said in a note on Monday. Local stocks will remain volatile this year as global central banks tweak rate policies, he added. In Hong Kong, fears of an Omicron outbreak grew as three cases were confirmed Sunday, including a Cathay Pacific aircrew member who is thought to be the source after breaking isolation rules. Cathay slipped 0.2 per cent to HK$6.38. China’s star manager hopes for redemption as all 4 funds with US$16 billion in assets suffered losses in 2021 Xpeng Motors jumped 5.9 per cent, leading gains among carmakers.

Xpeng and Li Auto posted record sales, while NIO ’s deliveries surpassed 10,000 units again in December. Caution remains after China reduced EV subsidies by 30 per cent on January 1 and prepares to remove them from next year. SenseTime jumped 41 per cent to HK$7.75, defying fears of sanctions surrounding its IPO late last month. Since its December 30 debut , the Chinese AI champion has soared 101 per cent from its IPO price of HK$3.85. Meanwhile, China Evergrande suspended its stock from trading, according to an exchange filing, without giving a reason.

"Top 15 Hong Kong IPOs to keep an eye on in 2022, as the city tries to put a difficult year behind it","15 IPOs to keep an eye on, as Hong Kong tries to put difficult year behind it","['Hong Kong’s main board dropped to third place last year from second in 2020 in international rankings', 'More than 70 per cent of firms that listed in the city in 2021 saw their stock prices trade below issue prices towards the end of the year']",Xinlu Liang,"After a strong first half, initial public offering (IPO) activity in Hong Kong – the top IPO market globally in seven of the past 13 years – slowed down for the rest of 2021. Ongoing geopolitical issues, regulatory changes affecting several industries in mainland China and speculation around interest rate hikes and reduced bond purchases have all taken a toll on the market. Hong Kong’s main board dropped to third place from second in 2020 in international rankings, as fundraising sank 17 per cent to US$42.6 billion as of December 28 last year, according to Refinitiv. That was lower than Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) , but higher than the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shanghai’s Star Market. Most Hong Kong listings in 2021 ended the year below their IPO price While Chinese AI champion SenseTime surprised investors with an outperformance, 96 IPOs or more than 70 per cent of Hong Kong debutants in 2021 saw their stock prices trade below their issue prices towards the end of the year. In 2022, analysts expect the Hong Kong IPO market to be less frenzied and more balanced, as geopolitical issues and China’s tightening grip on technology and property companies continue to be of concern. A new listing regime for overseas issuers should boost dual-primary and secondary IPOs by US-listed China concept stocks, while the Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) regime should draw some listings by de-SPAC targets, Deloitte China said. It expected about 120 new listings in Hong Kong to raise about HK$330 billion (US$42.3 billion) in 2022. Among these are candidates that delayed their IPOs because of uncertain market sentiment in 2021. Here are 15 potential IPOs to keep an eye out for: Didi Global Didi, China’s largest ride-hailing company, said in December that it would delist from NYSE and pursue a listing in Hong Kong. The company, with a market capitalisation of US$24 billion as of December 31 2021, did not give a reason for delisting, but its announcement followed a cybersecurity review by the Cyberspace Administration of China that kicked-off on July 2, two days after its IPO in New York. It has barred employees from selling their stock until after the Hong Kong listing, which currently has no timeline. One reason, according to an internal memo, is that the company must provide information to the US Securities and Exchange Commission about its stock incentive plan. Didi reported a 30.4 billion yuan (US$4.77 billion) loss and a 1.7 per cent decline in revenue to 42.7 billion yuan in the third quarter of 2021. FWD Group The Hong Kong-based insurer backed by tycoon Richard Li Tzar-kai, will drop its plan to list in New York and will sell shares on its hometown exchange in the first half of 2022. The insurer was aiming to raise up to US$3 billion in New York in September in an IPO that would value the group at US$13 billion. Its plans hit a roadblock in October when it did not receive approval, with US regulators raising questions about potential risks associated with the Chinese government extending its authority over Hong Kong-based firms. For the nine months ending in September, the value of FWD’s new business grew 36 per cent year on year to US$511 million, while its earnings totalled US$131 million. NIO NIO, the Shanghai-based electric vehicle (EV) start-up backed by Chinese social media giant Tencent Holdings, was reported by Reuters to be planning a listing in Hong Kong. It raised US$1.15 billion in 2018 from its IPO in the United States. The firm, which had a market capitalisation of US$50.39 billion as of December 31, 2021, reported 116.6 per cent growth in total revenue to US$1.52 billion for the third quarter of last year. Its net loss dropped year on year by 20 per cent to US$129.6 million. China Tourism Group China’s dominant duty-free retailer, which listed in Shanghai in 2009, announced on December 3 last year that it had postponed its multibillion dollar Hong Kong IPO, blaming sluggish market conditions for the decision. It had received the go ahead from bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing. The company was reportedly targeting between US$5 billion and US$7 billion in what was set to be Hong Kong’s biggest IPO in 2021. Zhuhai Wanda Commercial Management Group The commercial property management arm of Chinese real estate tycoon Wang Jianlin’s Dalian Wanda Group, had a valuation of US$28 billion, according to a preliminary listing document posted on the website of Hong Kong’s stock exchange in October 2021. It reportedly planned to raise up to US$4 billion. Leapmotor Sequoia Capital China-backed Leapmotor is working on a potential US$1 billion IPO in Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg. The Hangzhou-based EV firm, which is also backed by the Hangzhou government, had received 73,561 pre-orders and had delivered 44,013 vehicles, as of November 30, 2021. Lalamove Hong Kong-based on-demand logistics and delivery firm Lalamove , which is known as Houlala in China, is said to be considering moving its planned US$1 billion IPO from the US to Hong Kong. GogoX, a competitor, is also said to be considering a Hong Kong listing that could raise US$400 million to US$500 million. Ximalaya Ximalaya , China’s biggest podcasting platform, filed its Hong Kong IPO application in September after dropping plans to list in the US. Ximalaya is backed by technology giants such as Tencent, Xiaomi and Baidu, as well as Sony Music Entertainment, according to its initial US filings. It is said to be planning to raise about US$500 million. Little Red Book Xiaohongshu , or Little Red Book, is a social e-commerce app known as China’s answer to Instagram. The Shanghai-based company, which is backed by investors such as Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings, Tencent and Genesis Capital, has been valued at US$20 billion as of November 2021. The company was reported by Bloomberg as considering shifting its IPO to Hong Kong from the US, with the aim of raising at least US$500 million. The firm said in October that it did not have specific listing plans. Huitongda Network The Nanjing-based company , which is backed by Alibaba Group Holding, this newspaper’s owner, was reported to be planning to raise US$1 billion in an Hong Kong IPO. It posted a loss of 279.8 million yuan and revenue of 46.5 billion yuan for the first nine months of 2021, according to an updated listing prospectus filed with the Hong Kong exchange on December 24. Weilong Delicious Global Henan-based Weilong, which makes spicy soybean and egg snacks, is expected to raise US$1 billion. The company attracted eight pre-listing investors in March 2021, including Tencent , Citic Private Equity Funds, Hillhouse Capital and Yunfeng Capital. They invested in a total of US$549 million in the company. This will be its second attempt to list in Hong Kong, after its first application in May has expired. AIM Vaccine China’s second-largest vaccine maker after Sinopharm subsidiary China National Biotec Group, AIM is said to be planning to raise up to US$1 billion in a Hong Kong IPO. Backed by Puhua Capital and Everest VC, the company recorded 863 million yuan in net loss for the first half of 2021. Medbanks Health Technology The Tencent-backed Chinese medical data platform that focuses on oncology, is reported to be considering raising about US$1 billion in an Hong Kong IPO. It counts IDG and the family office of Wu Yajun, the chairwoman of property developer Longfor Group , among its investors. Beijing Fourth Paradigm Technology The Beijing-based artificial intelligence (AI) unicorn wants to follow in the footsteps of AI peer SenseTime, which listed in Hong Kong in December. Sequoia Capital, Sinovation Ventures, Lenovo Capital and Primavera Capital Group have invested in the company. It is expected to raise US$600 million, according to IFR. Last year, it reported 105 per cent year-on-year growth in revenue to 942 million yuan. Miniso Group Holding Miniso , a Chinese budget household and consumer goods retailer whose stock is already traded in New York, is reportedly considering a second listing in Hong Kong in 2022. The firm, which runs more than 4,200 stores in over 80 countries and regions, raised US$608 million on the NYSE in October 2020.",2022-01-03T09:30:23+08:00,2022-01-02T16:57:34+08:00,2022-01-07T15:16:41+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/article/3161853/15-ipos-keep-eye-2022-hong-kong-tries-put-difficult,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/02/72109658-ea65-44b5-8b43-d790776f00b5_e57c837e.jpg?itok=6IBcXl4B&v=1641113855,Investor Relations

A government report showed Chinese manufacturing expanded this month, beating expectations. The Hang Seng Tech Index appreciated 3.6 per cent as trading ended for the year, with valuations appealing to buyers. It was the biggest gain since December 7. The Hang Seng Index rose 1.2 per cent o 23,397.67 while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index advanced 1.7 per cent to 8,236.35. Alibaba Group Holding, the owner of this newspaper, led the charge with an 8.2 per cent jump to HK$118.90. Its health information unit rose 4.6 per cent from more than a one-year low to HK$6.59.

Hong Kong’s stock market finished trading for the year at noon, while the trading hours in mainland bourses remained unchanged. In Shanghai, the Composite Index rose 0.6 per cent to close the year at 3,639.78. In the technology hub of Shenzhen, the benchmark Composite Index advanced 0.5 per cent to end the year at 2,530.14. Gains in tech stocks mirrored an overnight rally in American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Chinese companies traded in the United States. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index of 93 stocks soared 9.4 per cent for its biggest gain since 2008, according to Bloomberg data. “Today’s gains are just a small consolation as big tech names like Alibaba and Tencent still face some [regulatory] pressure from authorities,” said Zheng Yufei, an analyst at Guosen Securities (HK). “Next year, we will instead see more opportunities in other areas like digital securities and metaverse.” The 30-member Hang Seng Tech Index tumbled 33 per cent in 2021, erasing about US$600 billion of market value in a year damaged by a sweeping regulatory crackdown in mainland China. That sent the index’s price-earnings multiple to 14 times, the cheapest since its inception. The Hang Seng Index fell 14 per cent in 2021, making Hong Kong the worst-performing market out of 92 major indexes tracked by Bloomberg. Only the city’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the performance of Chinese companies, fared worse, retracing 23.3 per cent over the past 12 months. Today’s advance helped narrow the Hang Seng’s decline in December to 0.2 per cent. The gauge fell about 14 per cent for the year, the worst among major global indices. January was the best month, with a 3.4 per cent gain, while July marked the worst with a 10 per cent slump. Stocks in mainland markets advanced on Friday amid signs of sustained growth in factory activity. The official PMI manufacturing index rose to 50.3 this month from 50.1 in November, the statistics bureau said on Friday.

Alibaba Group Holding , which owns this newspaper, fell 2.6 per cent and Tencent Holdings lost 1.2 per cent. “Towards the end of the year, people are being cautious. They are waiting for a clearer direction in the market, while keeping an eye on Omicron developments,” said Louis Tse Ming-kwong, managing director at Wealthy Securities. On Monday, Beijing unveiled regulations that bar companies in sensitive industries from receiving foreign investment , unless they seek a waiver from the government. This has sent jitters through the Chinese internet sector, sending the Tech Index to its lowest level since its inception in July 2020. The gauge was on track for a 9.4 per cent loss in December, its fourth monthly loss in five. About US$760 billion in market value has been erased since the end of June, when Chinese authorities launched a cybersecurity investigation into Didi Global. Chinese property developers also declined on Wednesday. China Aoyuan Group was summoned by a Hong Kong court for guaranteeing US$131 million in debt for a subsidiary, according to an exchange filing on Tuesday.

Miniso weighs a 2022 IPO in Hong Kong as more US-listed Chinese stocks return to Asia,"Miniso is weighing an IPO in Hong Kong next year, sources say","['The firm is working with Bank of America (BofA) and UBS Group on the proposed share sale, according to people familiar with the matter', 'Miniso could raise a few hundred million dollars in Hong Kong, they said']",Bloomberg,"Miniso Group Holding, a Chinese budget household and consumer goods retailer whose stock is already traded in New York, is considering a second listing in Hong Kong next year, people with knowledge of the matter said. The firm is working with Bank of America (BofA) and UBS Group on the proposed share sale, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Miniso could raise a few hundred million dollars in Hong Kong, they said. Deliberations are at an early stage, and details such as fundraising size and timing could change, the people said. Representatives for Miniso and BofA declined to comment. UBS didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The discount store operator is looking to join a slew of US-traded Chinese firms such as Baidu , Xpeng and Weibo in conducting so-called homecoming listings. Could there be an exodus of Chinese tech stocks from US markets? As Sino-US tensions simmer and threaten to block Chinese companies’ access to US capital markets, some of them are seeking a foothold back home as a hedge against risks. Under a bill passed in the US , Chinese companies could be kicked out of exchanges there if American regulators aren’t allowed to review their audits.

More misses than hits suggest investors will struggle with regulatory minefields in the US$13.7 trillion onshore equity market. Two months after selecting 50 companies whose businesses are best aligned with President Xi Jinping’s wealth-sharing mantra, only 18 of them have prospered while the other 32 handed investors losses, according to data compiled by the Post . Trip.com slumped 30 per cent since October 21 when the US bank published its 50-stock universe, making the travel operator the worst of the lot. Xinyi Solar, China Feihe, Senior Technology Materials, Yunnan Energy New Material and Tongcheng E-long made up the top laggards with 20 to 28 per cent slide. Zhejiang Supor led the winners with a 40 per cent rally. Luxshare Precision, Wingtech Technology, Han’s Laser Technology and Thunder Software followed next with 21 to 35 per cent appreciation over the two-month period. The early results underpin concerns that more pain may be in store for investors. The MSCI China Index, a collection of 741 stocks with US$2.6 trillion capitalisation, has underperformed the broader emerging markets this year by the most since 2004, according to Bloomberg data, with regulatory worries and economic slowdown at play. “[Chinese equities are] still at a critical juncture,” Morgan Stanley said in its 2022 market outlook report. “We still see lingering risks into 2022, [including] earnings headwinds, extended tight liquidity, US-China non-trade tensions, and near term property market volatility.” China’s path to common prosperity puts pressure on private enterprise Goldman constructed its prosperity portfolio of 50 stocks with buy and neutral recommendations from its analysts. It comprises 39 yuan-denominated shares, 10 traded in Hong Kong currency and one listed in New York, with US$1 trillion in combined market capitalisation. The portfolio trades on 26 times estimated 2022 earnings and is expected to grow earnings at a compound rate of 27 per cent annually through 2023. In comparison, the MSCI China Index traded at about 12.4 times forward earnings at the end of November. Common prosperity is widely regarded as a key policy motivation for unprecedented shifts in the regulation and governance framework, strategists including Kinger Lau said in the October report. It could guide investment themes in the years to come, they said. While investment aligned to China’s long-term policy goals has been “historically rewarding”, the idea may be too broad for some investors. Alibaba, Tencent and Chinese tech stocks are good values with policy conditions priced in, Lombard Odier says “There are many ways to interpret common prosperity, so it’s not something we pay a lot of emphasis on,” said June Chua, co-head of Asian and emerging markets equities in Hong Kong at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, which manages more than US$75 billion of assets globally. “Our focus is looking at sustainable business models, something within our control.” As regulatory uncertainty persists, investors are instead seeking gains in sectors that enjoy policy tailwinds. Fidelity International favours sectors that align with China’s next phase of economic development, such as high-end manufacturing, renewable energy, electric vehicles, software and next-generation health care. “China appears determined to move to an economic model geared to the real economy, rolling back debt and addressing inequalities, rather than reacting to any downside in financial assets,” Victoria Mio, director of Asian equities at Fidelity, said in its market outlook report. “This should be helpful for markets in the long run, increasing moral hazard and enabling investors to price assets more accurately,” she added. “For investors with a long-term horizon, 2022 will be a good time to start building positions in Chinese equities.” It’s certainly too early to judge Goldman’s top picks after two months as China began to indicate its readiness to loosen its grip on liquidity levers, borrowing costs and possibly fiscal purse strings to stabilise growth next year. Goldman’s common prosperity portfolio, designed to be less sensitive to the ongoing regulation shifts and the activity slowdown in the property market, could also react more favourably to potential macro policy easing, the strategists said.",2021-12-24T07:30:20+08:00,2021-12-23T14:57:28+08:00,2021-12-24T07:30:20+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3160802/goldmans-18-wins-32-losses-common-prosperity-bets-show-pain,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/23/98e1fe22-2f60-4f49-8a9e-9ac6e479b4ed_d7bff196.jpg?itok=34yiOkIJ&v=1640242649,Companies
"SenseTime’s Hong Kong IPO oversubscribed, minus American investors after US sanctions",SenseTime IPO oversubscribed even after excluding US investors,"['The artificial intelligence (AI) company may have received orders for about HK$2 billion from retail investors when the books closed at noon on Thursday', 'The 2.3-times oversubscription pales in comparison to the four-times that SenseTime received earlier this month before its addition to a US sanctions list']",Enoch Yiu,"SenseTime Group’s initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong was oversubscribed, as global investors – minus Americans – shrugged aside US sanctions to bid for shares in one of the world’s premier artificial intelligence (AI) companies. SenseTime received about HK$2 billion (US$256 million) of orders for the retail tranche of its relaunched IPO when the books closed at noon, an oversubscription of about 2.3 times, according to estimates by brokers. Shares of the company will trade for the first time on December 30, marking Hong Kong’s biggest IPO since September. The result paled in comparison with the four-times oversubscription received by the Hong Kong-based company in early December before it was added to the US government’s sanctions list under the Uygur Forced Labor Protection Act . Even though the sanction did not bar US investors – both institutional funds and individual investors – from owning shares of SenseTime, the company excluded them from its stock sale. “SenseTime’s current offering excluded Americans from buying its shares, which limited the pool of investors buying the stock,” said Tom Chan Pak-lam, chairman of Hong Kong Institute of Securities Dealers, an industry body of local brokers. “However, the quick relaunch and the oversubscription proves the resilience of Hong Kong’s IPO market when it’s faced with US sanctions.” SenseTime postponed its IPO last week, becoming the biggest corporate casualty yet of the US legislation that passed earlier this month in the US House of Representatives. Two days after the law passed, the US put SenseTime on its sanctions list during the first round of IPO. The act contains a “rebuttable presumption” clause that assumes all goods coming from western China’s Xinjiang region are made with forced labour – and thus banned – unless the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection gives an exception. How professors in Hong Kong built the world’s largest AI unicorn Even though US law did not specifically bar Americans from owning SenseTime’s shares, the company delayed its stock sale to enhance its risk closure in a supplemental prospectus, while describing US accusations of its role in Xinjiang ’s rights ambitions as “unfounded” characterisations that reflected a “fundamental misperception” of the company. The relaunched IPO maintained the same number of shares on offer and pricing, selling 1.5 billion shares at between HK$3.85 and HK$3.99, with 10 per cent of the shares for retail IPO while the rest was reserved for international offering. The international offering closed on Wednesday was also fully subscribed, brokers said. SenseTime lined up nine cornerstone investors, selling US$511.6 million of shares to them to anchor the stock sale. That was an increase from the US$450 million when the IPO first kicked off on December 6. New investors include the HK STP Venture Fund, a fund under the city government’s Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP). Other new cornerstone investors include Guotai Junan Investments, a unit of mainland financial firm Guotai Junan. They replaced several cornerstone investors who withdrew their investments after the US sanctions, including Focustar Capital and Pleaid Funds.",2021-12-23T17:33:50+08:00,2021-12-23T17:33:47+08:00,2021-12-23T18:01:08+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3160834/sensetimes-hong-kong-ipo-oversubscribed-minus-american,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/23/fb94f658-9726-46c8-bb81-e64abb137fbd_df36d630.jpg?itok=6BzJivuC&v=1640252028,Banking & Finance

JD.com tumbled. The Hang Seng Index gained 0.4 per cent to 23,193.64 at the close of Thursday trading. The Tech Index slipped 0.8 per cent, while China’s Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.6 per cent. Tencent, the WeChat operator, surged 4.2 per cent to HK$461.80, the most in two months. It proposed on Thursday to distribute a large chunk of its shareholding in JD.com valued at HK$127.7 billion (US$16.4 billion) as dividend in specie. The rally added about US$180 billion to its market capitalisation. JD.com crashed 7 per cent to HK$259.60, set for the worst decline since a 9.4 per cent sell-off on July 26, on concerns it may lose support from one of China’s biggest tech companies. The dividend plan will leave Chairman and CEO Richard Liu Qiandong and Walmart as JD.com’s biggest shareholders, based on its most-recent annual report. “Other tech giants are likely to follow suit as Chinese authorities would like these big companies to reduce their market share in other sectors,” said Gary Ching, vice-president of research at Guosen Securities. “The risk is transferred to retail investors, so they should be cautious of such dividend actions.” The Hang Seng Index, however, has fallen about 15 per cent this year with US$283 billion of market value erased from its 64 blue-chip members. The setback ranks Hong Kong as the worst performer among major global stock markets, unable to overturn losses caused by a series of regulatory crackdown and an economic slowdown. Alibaba Group Holding, the owner of this newspaper, fell 1.4 per cent while Meituan retreated 1.7 per cent on concerns Chinese regulators are continuing to monitor tech companies for breaches. Recent trends, however, suggest investor sentiment on Hong Kong stocks is improving. Mainland investors have ploughed more money into local shares for 21 consecutive days, making it a good time to buy, said Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities in Hong Kong. Three firms started trading for the first time on the mainland. Yongan Futures Co soared 44 per cent. Nantong Chaoda Equipment surged 117 per cent and Henan Carve Electronics Technology jumped 78 per cent.

The Hang Seng Tech Index increased 1.3 per cent, set for the best two-day advance in two weeks. Alibaba Group Holding ended 0.9 per cent stronger, after surging as much as 5.3 per cent. NetEase, Bilibili and JD.com rallied by 1.9 per cent to 5.7 per cent. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks US-listed Chinese stocks, surged 7 per cent in overnight New York trading, the most in four months. “Hong Kong stocks have finally rebounded after heavy losses, but overall investor sentiment has not improved much,” said Stanley Chik, research director of Bright Smart Securities in a note on Wednesday. “Gains could be narrowing.” Local stocks recovered after a 16 per cent slump in 2021 sent valuations of Hang Seng Index’s 64 members to about 11.7 times projected earnings on average, the cheapest after Brazil among major global markets, according to Bloomberg data.

Hong Kong’s 2021 IPO ranking slips to fourth place as fundraising shriveled by 20 per cent amid China’s...,Hong Kong’s 2021 IPO rank slips to 4th place as China clamps down,"['HKEX data confirms forecast by accounting firms such as KPMG, which predicted earlier that the Hong Kong exchange would not be in top three IPO venues globally this year', '92 companies raised US$40.9 billion as of December 17 this year, 20 per cent less than the decade-high recorded in 2020 as a whole']",Enoch Yiu,"Hong Kong’s annual tally of initial public offerings ( IPOs ) shrank this year for the first time since 2017, as a regulatory crackdown on technology companies in mainland China sent a chill through the market and hurt fundraising activity in the second half of 2021. Several accounting firms, including KPMG, Ernst and Young and Deloitte had forecast earlier that the Hong Kong stock exchange would not make it into the top three IPO venues globally this year and was likely to drop to fourth place from second last year. Data from bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) confirmed this prediction on Tuesday. A total of 92 companies raised HK$318.9 billion (US$40.88 billion) as of December 17 this year, 20 per cent less than the decade-high of US$50.9 billion recorded in 2020 as a whole, HKEX data shows. “IPOs in Hong Kong have either shifted their timetable beyond this year, or scaled down their fundraising size since the third quarter, on the back of market and regulatory uncertainties [emanating] from China,” said Louis Lau, a Hong Kong-based partner with the capital markets advisory group at KPMG China. Hong Kong has been the largest IPO market worldwide in seven out of the past 12 years. However, since Beijing started undertaking a range of regulatory reforms in July to crackdown on technology companies and private tutoring businesses, new listings have slowed down, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2021. Only 21 firms raised US$4.98 billion in Hong Kong between October and December 17. The city was, as of November, behind the Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange and the Shanghai Stock Exchange , according to HKEX as well as Dealogic. The full-year figure is set to rise slightly after SenseTime Group said it will relaunch its US$767 million share sale this week before listing on the Hong Kong exchange on December 30. The listing will, however, not change the track for Hong Kong’s exchange. This year’s total amount raised through IPOs is expected to be the lowest since 2018, when the exchange raised US$37.38 billion. The total number of new listings will be the lowest since 2012, which saw 57 IPOs. HKEX, however, said the exchange had a “robust year” in 2021. Fifty-four new economy companies listed in the city and accounted for 86 per cent of all funds raised in Hong Kong, it said. In comparison, such firms accounted for only 6.9 per cent of IPOs in 2017. Hong Kong started allowing companies with multiple voting rights structures and pre-revenue biotechnology firms to list in April 2018. This has paved the way for giants such as Alibaba Group Holding, this newspaper’s parent, and search engine operator Baidu to list in the city. Nicolas Aguzin, HKEX’s CEO, said the outlook remained positive as the exchange will start accepting listings by special purpose acquisition companies from January 1, even as more than 200 IPO applications were in the pipeline as of the end of September. “We expect that IPO activity in Hong Kong will become more steady around the third quarter of 2022,” KPMG’s Lau said at the firm’s IPO review and outlook briefing earlier this month . Hong Kong’s IPO market had a strong first half, with mega deals such as that by short-video platform Kuaishou Tech raised US$6.2 billion in the world’s third-biggest IPO. “The outlook for next year is more positive. After the mainland Chinese regulatory activity has settled, more mainland technology giants and biotechnology firms will list here,” said Louis Tse Ming-kwong, managing director of Hong Kong-based broker Wealthy Securities. “Hong Kong could also expect more listings by US-listed Chinese issuers looking to escape potential sanctions from Washington. This will help Hong Kong’s IPO market turn around next year,” he added. FWD Group, which is controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Richard Li Tzar-kai, said in a filing on Monday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had decided not to proceed with its New York listing and would consider an IPO in Hong Kong next year. Earlier this month, Didi Chuxing said it would delist from the US and planed a listing in Hong Kong, as and when the SEC announced the implementation of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. The legislation will pave the way for delisting companies from US exchanges if they fail to allow audit reviews for three straight years, a window that is expected to expire by late-2023. “An acceleration in listings by [US-listed Chinese issuers] will be a highlight of Hong Kong’s IPO market in 2022,” Edward Au, southern region managing partner at Deloitte China, said at a briefing on Monday.",2021-12-21T18:50:12+08:00,2021-12-21T18:42:43+08:00,2021-12-22T09:24:48+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3160564/hong-kong-ipo-funds-raised-fall-20-cent-and-city-slips-fourth,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/21/4da25414-db5b-409d-9027-b5fe8c888c31_b77f2cb9.jpg?itok=kcaAY3Wl&v=1640083364,Companies

Evergrande crashed 9.9 per cent while Shimao lost 8.6 per cent. Country Garden lost 4.1 per cent while its services unit sank 5.8 per cent. The market trended lower despite the People’s Bank of China cutting the loan prime rate (LPR) – its benchmark borrowing cost – on Monday. The LPR was reduced for the first time since April 2020.

The artificial intelligence (AI) company, founded by a group of professors from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), will issue 1.5 billion shares at between HK$3.85 and HK$3.99, valuing the start-up at HK$132.8 billion (US$17 billion) at the top end.

The retail offering starts today until Thursday, for the company’s shares to commence trading on the Hong Kong exchange on December 30.

That was an increase from the US$450 million when the IPO first kicked off on December 6. New investors include the HK STP Venture Fund, a fund under the city government’s Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP). Other new cornerstone investors include Guotai Junan Investments, a unit of mainland financial firm Guotai Junan. They replaced several cornerstone investors who withdrew their investments after the US sanctions, including Focustar Capital and Pleaid Funds. Alibaba Group Holding, the owner of this newspaper, was an early investor in SenseTime’s US$600 million Series C funding round in 2018. “HKSTP has become a cornerstone investor in SenseTime’s initial public offering … to support the company’s R&D and future development,” an HKSTP spokesman said, noting that the company has been based in Hong Kong Science Park since its establishment in 2014. SenseTime postponed its IPO last week, becoming the biggest corporate casualty yet of the Uygur Forced Labor Prevention Act , which was passed earlier this month in the US House of Representatives. The act contains a “rebuttable presumption” clause that assumes all goods coming from China’s Xinjiang region are made with forced labour, and thus banned, unless the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection gives an exception. Two days after the law passed, the US Treasury Department put SenseTime on its sanctions list. SenseTime has rejected US accusations that it aided human right abuses in Xinjiang calling them “unfounded” accusations that reflected a “fundamental misperception” of the company. In the additional prospectus, SenseTime said its products and services are not intended for any military applications but it still warned of the risks of being added to other US sanction lists in future. “In such a case, our ability to raise funds, especially from US investors, could be limited; and the liquidity of our publicly traded shares could be adversely affected,” it said. SenseTime will exclude US persons from buying its shares even though the US sanction placed on a wholly-owned subsidiary of the listed company carries no legal effect on the IPO issuer. “Due to the dynamic and evolving nature of the relevant US regulations, we have required to exclude US investors from subscribing for shares in the global offering, including those in the Hong Kong public offering,” SenseTime said.

Tesla signs deal to source key battery component graphite from Mozambique in bid to reduce dependence on China,"Tesla to source graphite, a key battery component, from Mozambique","['Tesla will buy graphite from Australia’s Syrah Resources’ processing plant in Vidalia, Louisiana, which sources the mineral from its mine in Balama, Mozambique', 'The deal is part of Tesla’s plan to ramp up its capacity to make its own batteries so it can reduce its dependence on China, which dominates global graphite markets, analyst says']",Associated Press,"Tesla is turning to Mozambique for a key component in its electric car batteries in what analysts believe is a first-of-its-kind deal designed to reduce its dependence on China for graphite. Elon Musk ’s company signed an agreement last month with Australia’s Syrah Resources, which operates one of the world’s largest graphite mines in the southern African country. It’s a unique partnership between an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer and a producer of the mineral that is critical for lithium-ion batteries. The value of the deal has not been released. Tesla will buy the material from the company’s processing plant in Vidalia, Louisiana, which sources graphite from its mine in Balama, Mozambique. The Austin, Texas-based EV maker plans to buy up 80 per cent of what the plant produces – 8,000 tons of graphite per year – starting in 2025, according to the agreement. Syrah must prove the material meets Tesla’s standards. The deal is part of Tesla’s plan to ramp up its capacity to make its own batteries so it can reduce its dependence on China, which dominates global graphite markets, said Simon Moores of United Kingdom-based battery materials data and intelligence provider, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. “It starts at the top with geopolitics,” Moores said. “The US wants to build enough capacity domestically to be able to build [lithium-ion batteries] within the USA. And this deal will permit Tesla to source graphite independent from China.” Moores said producing the batteries in the US will reduce some of the questions Tesla is facing about its ties to China, where there are environmental concerns at some mines. The carmaker also has set up a showroom in the autonomous region of Xinjiang , where Chinese officials are accused of forced labour and other human rights abuses against mostly Muslim ethnic minorities. A message was left seeking comment from Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department. Urgent need for EV battery industry to expand and be more sustainable to meet future demand The battery industry has been confronted with a short supply of graphite in recent months, Moores said. Graphite stores lithium inside a battery until it’s needed to generate electricity by splitting into charged ions and electrons. It comes as every major carmaker is racing to get into EVs amid concerns about climate change . Tesla is making almost a million electric cars per year, and sourcing enough batteries is its biggest constraint, he said. “They’ve upped their own battery manufacturing capacity,” Moores said, but still “they can’t get enough batteries”. A new battery factory that the company is building in its new hometown of Austin, Texas, will allow it to get closer to self-sufficiency, but Moores said it is still buying batteries from other manufacturers, “and that won’t change this decade”. For instance, Tesla has a deal with Panasonic to make battery cells at the carmaker’s battery factory near Reno, Nevada. The deal with Syrah is part of a broader effort by carmakers to secure relatively scarce raw materials for batteries as demand for EVs is expected to grow, said Sam Abuelsamid, principal e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Insights. The deal also brings the graphite processed in Louisiana much closer to Tesla’s US factories. Chip shortage leaves Tesla and other electric car buyers in China waiting months for new vehicles “The pandemic pointed out to us that we’ve got these long, long, long supply chains, and it doesn’t take much to disrupt a supply chain,” said Donald Sadoway, a professor of materials chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Somebody could all of the sudden say, ‘We’re going to jack up the prices’, or ‘We’re going to refuse to ship it’.” It’s unlikely that the Tesla deal with Syrah will rankle the Chinese government because China has plenty of markets for its graphite, including increased domestic EV production, Abuelsamid said. China, though, is Tesla’s biggest global market. It has a giant factory near Shanghai and sells about 450,000 vehicles per year there, compared with about 350,000 in the US, Abuelsamid said. For the Australian mining firm, the deal is “crucial” because it has a non-Chinese buyer for its graphite product, Moores said. Syrah’s graphite mine in Mozambique’s northernmost province, Cabo Delgado, is one of the world’s largest, with an ability to produce 350,000 tons of flake graphite a year. Cabo Delgado has faced violence in recent years by Islamic extremists, an insurgency that has recently extended inland from coastal areas towards the neighbouring Niassa province. The mine is on the main road connecting the Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces, a thoroughfare that has been recently upgraded by a Chinese contractor. At a ceremony to reopen the road in December, President Filipe Nyusi called for vigilance so the road isn’t used by insurgents.",2022-01-16T18:43:29+08:00,2022-01-16T18:34:14+08:00,2022-01-16T18:50:56+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/commodities/article/3163588/tesla-signs-deal-source-key-battery-component-graphite,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/16/604d89d4-0396-4a48-9f49-ea026bf15158_cbb70a72.jpg?itok=qwanaPN9&v=1642329257,Commodities
China meets Gulf oil bloc with sights set on free-trade agreement and energy security,"China meets Gulf oil bloc with sights set on trade deal, energy security","['High-level delegation of Gulf Cooperation Council members visited China this week and agreed that conditions are ripe for a strategic partnership', 'However, few specifics are given on potential energy cooperation, and previous rounds of talks and strategic dialogues failed to produce such a free-trade agreement']",Frank Tang,"As China scrambles to ensure a stable supply of energy, Beijing is looking to boost bilateral relations with oil-abundant Gulf countries by entering into a strategic partnership and expediting the implementation of a free-trade agreement. In a rare move, Beijing invited a high-level delegation of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members, including its secretary general and the foreign ministers of four member countries – Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain – for a China visit this week . “The two sides agreed that the conditions are ripe to establish a strategic partnership. We will accelerate the process and elevate bilateral relations to a new level,” the Chinese foreign ministry said after Tuesday meeting’s between GCC Secretary General Nayef Falah Al-Hajraf and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The ministry said both sides agreed to negotiate a bilateral free-trade agreement as soon as possible, after nine rounds of talks since 2004. ‘Self-sufficiency’ in key commodities vital for China: Xi Jinping “We will leverage the geographical advantages of GCC countries,” the statement said. “We will share China’s vast market opportunities, help GCC countries become regional logistics and shipping hubs, and attract more capital and technology investment to the Gulf region.” When China applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement, Beijing used the opportunity to push forward bilateral and regional trade deals, and the 15-member Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership took effect at the beginning of this month. Given that China imports more than 70 per cent of its crude-oil requirements, and with Beijing looking to insulate the energy lifeline from price volatility and shipping disruptions, free-trade talks with Gulf countries keep the focus on energy security. The Tuesday meeting statement, however, revealed few specifics about energy cooperation. He Weiwen, a senior fellow with the Centre for China and Globalisation, said the Gulf region plays an important role in Beijing’s plan to build a high-level, free-trade network with several countries. Meanwhile, “these [Gulf] countries are … boosting industrialisation, as shown in the Saudi Vision 2030 [development blueprint], which means there is a lot of room for investment and cooperation”, he said. The world’s second-largest economy imported 375 million tonnes of crude oil from six GCC countries in 2020, marking an increase of 140 per cent from a year earlier and accounting for 69 per cent of China’s total crude-oil imports. Overall crude imports rose 6.9 per cent from a year earlier to 99.78 million tonnes in the first half of last year, according to data from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. China after natural gas from Russia amid deteriorating ties with Australia, US “The visit of such a high-level [Gulf] delegation at the beginning of the new year signals that it wants to strengthen economic and trade cooperation with China,” former commerce minister Wei Jianguo wrote in an article for China Going Global think tank on Tuesday. “As the world’s largest crude-oil and natural-gas supplier and buyer, they need to sit down to negotiate how to achieve decarbonisation goals after the COP26 climate summit .” The six-member regional bloc, which also includes Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, controls about 45 per cent of the world’s crude-oil reserves. Its members are also all part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative . China replaced the European Union as the bloc’s largest trading partner in 2020, when bilateral trade was valued at US$161.4 billion, according to the Chinese foreign ministry. China’s imports from the bloc dropped 18.7 per cent to US$90.6 billion in 2020 as the price of crude plunged, but its exports to the bloc rose 5 per cent to US$70.8 billion that year. The ministry also said China’s imports from the bloc rose 35.6 per cent to US$63 billion in the first half of 2021, while exports grew 29 per cent to US$40.8 billion. Wei noted that economic cooperation between China and the Gulf bloc is mutually beneficial, and that now is the best time for them to sign a free-trade agreement. “The GCC has abundant crude oil and natural gas that China wants. Similarly, [the GCC] needs Chinese electronics, electromechanical, light industry and textile products, as well as hi-tech goods,” he wrote. Separate from their nine rounds of talks in the past 18 years, the two sides also agreed to hold their fourth strategic dialogue – dating back to 2012 – in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as soon as possible. They also agreed to jointly formulate a three-year action plan for the strategic dialogues to introduce new content, with the potential to expand to new areas of bilateral cooperation, the statement said.",2022-01-12T21:30:23+08:00,2022-01-12T18:41:16+08:00,2022-01-12T21:30:23+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3163121/china-meets-gulf-oil-bloc-sights-set-free-trade-agreement-and,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/12/35f8d4b2-7ad4-4053-90cd-e0ae06d0b3c3_5fabe43f.jpg?itok=4YpVQDCq&v=1641984082,China Economy
China’s pandemic-hit businesses see tax cuts and fee reductions extended in bid to kick off new year on a...,China’s pandemic-hit businesses see lifelines extended to kick off new year,"['Premier Li Keqiang has been outspoken about the need to protect what is considered the ‘backbone’ of China’s economy, and he vows support measures will continue', 'Since 2016, tax and fee cuts have saved market entities a total of 8.6 trillion yuan (US$1.35 trillion)']",Luna Sun,"China will continue to ease the burdens of taxes and fees on businesses in the service industry and other sectors that have been crippled by the pandemic and suffered job losses, in a bid to kick off the year’s first quarter with more stable economic prospects, according to Premier Li Keqiang. Amid recurrent talks of China doubling down on tax cuts to help support small and micro businesses , the tax-reduction policies that were due to expire at the end of last year will be extended for those businesses, Li said on Wednesday during a meeting to discuss such support measures. “Affected by multiple factors at home and abroad, China’s economy is faced with new downward pressures,” he said. “The reduction of taxes and administrative fees is a key measure of macro control. The cuts will emphasise the support for upgrading the manufacturing sector, and for a large number and wide range of medium, small-sized and micro businesses that help create many jobs.” The central government will also step up financial support for city- and county-level governments, while clamping down on tax evasion, Li added. China vows ‘no forgiveness’ for tax cheats in ‘common prosperity’ drive Cuts on taxes and administrative fees have proved effective in stabilising and energising the economy, the premier noted. Since 2016, the first year of the 13th five-year plan, tax and fee cuts have saved market entities a total of 8.6 trillion yuan (US$1.35 trillion) and further bolstered consumption and investment, as well as stabilised economic growth, employment and inflation, Li said. China’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) account for half of the country’s tax revenue, 60 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP), 70 per cent of technological innovations, and 80 per cent of urban employment. They have also been bearing the brunt of the economic downturn brought by the pandemic. To ease the burdens facing SMEs, the central and local governments have been lowering fees and taxes. The State Taxation Administration recorded a total of 910 billion yuan (US$143 billion) worth of reduced taxes and fees during the first three quarters of 2021. Local governments, including those of Hubei, Tianjin and Shandong, have also rolled out tax- and fee-reduction measures. An economic recovery slowdown, compounded by a property market slump , energy crisis , weak consumer sentiment and soaring raw material costs, has driven policymakers to repeatedly stress the vital role of stability. China’s economy grew by 4.9 per cent in the third quarter of 2021 compared with a year earlier, down from the 7.9 per cent growth seen in the second quarter. Last month, leaders of the world’s second-largest economy warned of “threefold pressure” facing China’s economy – a contraction of demand, supply shocks and weaker expectations. Consumption has been especially weak as the service sector has remained continuingly depressed by the recurrent coronavirus outbreaks, and several economists and analysts have said China’s zero-Covid strategy will continue to hold back a recovery in services. During Wednesday’s meeting, Li also pointed out that measures such as reductions and exemptions of social insurance premiums will also ease the burdens for businesses while promoting innovation and industrial upgrades. “Tax and fee cuts have helped generate a large number of market entities, and the tax payment of new market entities has increased year by year, which has played a role in cultivating tax sources and expanding the tax base,” Li said.",2022-01-06T20:00:27+08:00,2022-01-06T18:14:14+08:00,2022-01-07T09:16:20+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3162393/chinas-pandemic-hit-businesses-see-tax-cuts-and-fee,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/07/28dafaf6-fa07-468b-9a41-902250eefd05_26dc08be.jpg?itok=GhCOwC9S&v=1641518187,China Economy
China food security: top soybean region Heilongjiang unveils plan to ramp up annual harvest,China’s top soy region vows more output as food security worries take root,"['China’s northeastern province of Heilongjiang will increase soybean output by 1.3 million tonnes this year', 'President Xi Jinping has called for more planting of soybean and oil crops to safeguard grain security']",Orange Wang,"China’s largest soybean producing province has taken its first step to boost production in 2022, following Beijing’s recent warning about dependence on imports for a commodity regarded as essential to national food security. The northeastern province of Heilongjiang, which produces about 40 per cent of China’s total soybean output and accounts for a similar level of acreage, has set a target of planting more than 666,667 hectares (1.6 million acres) of soybeans this year, according to provincial Communist Party chief Xu Qin. Annual soybean output is expected to increase by 1.3 million tonnes, Xu said in an interview with state-owned Xinhua News Agency published on Saturday. The figure, if achieved, would be a nearly 8 per cent addition to the total national soybean yield in 2021. Heilongjiang’s move follows a call from President Xi Jinping for more planting of soybean and oil crops this year to safeguard grain security. Panic buying in China, but is there a food security concern? “Ensuring the supply of primary products is a major strategic issue, the rice bowls of the Chinese people must be firmly held in our own hands at all times and filled with Chinese grains,” Xi said in a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee in late December, according to Xinhua. China’s top decision makers have warned that shortages of primary products, including soybeans, iron ore and crude oil, could become a “ grey rhino ” risk – an obvious yet ignored threat – for the world’s No 2 economy. China must establish a “strategic baseline” to ensure self-sufficiency in key resources, and while the country should make use of both domestic and external markets, it must not cross a “safety line” for imports, Xi told the central economic work conference last month. More than 80 per cent of the soybeans China consumes each year are imported, mostly from Brazil and the United States, since the country cannot produce enough to support its large and rapidly growing livestock industry. The reliance is seen as a weak link for the country’s agricultural sector and overall food security. Soybeans became a major battlefield between Beijing and Washington during the Trump-era trade war. Buying more American farm goods, including soybeans, is an important commitment made by the Chinese government in the phase one trade deal. China imported 8.57 million tonnes of soybeans in November, surging 67.7 per cent from the previous month, but still down 10.6 per cent from a year ago, the latest customs data showed. During the first 11 months of the year, China imported nearly 87.7 million tonnes of soybeans, 5.6 per cent less than a year ago. ‘An eternal task’: China strives to safeguard grain, diversify imports Of those, some 26.2 million tonnes were imported from the US, up 47.4 per cent from the same period in 2020, although China’s purchases of US agricultural products remained well below the target made in the interim trade agreement. “The high degree of import dependence means China does not have a say in the international market for soybeans,” said Wang Yanru, senior analyst at soy industry portal Dadoutianxia.com. She added increasing acreage would help stabilise prices for domestic soybeans. China’s agricultural ministry told local governments late in 2021 that enlarging soybean and oil crop planting was “a major political task” to be completed this year. Recovering soybean planting acreage in China’s northeast is at the top of the to-do list. China’s annual domestic soybean yield shrank 16.4 per cent from a year earlier to 16.4 million tonnes in 2021, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Soybean acreage declined by 14.8 per cent, or 1.4 million hectares last year, “mainly because the income from soybeans is lower than that of corn, leading to a lower willingness among farmers to plant”, the bureau said. Heilongjiang’s planting plan could make up half of China’s total decline in soybean acreage last year, but it is still not enough for the province to return to its height of about 6.7 million hectares in 2020. Chinese authorities are pushing for a higher per unit yield for key crops like soybeans, possibly through an acceleration in genetically modified seeds . However, official data showed soybean yield per unit area fell by 1.8 per cent in 2021. In the past year, the country has moved closer towards the commercialisation of genetically modified varieties, including by overhauling regulations .",2022-01-03T22:15:16+08:00,2022-01-03T19:36:32+08:00,2022-01-04T11:30:23+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3161977/china-food-security-top-soybean-region-heilongjiang-unveils,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/03/382ec2ec-5d26-4c54-8935-4c8e7bf977b2_3bab0e39.jpg?itok=WokhSSW5&v=1641209796,China Economy
China vows greater iron ore self-sufficiency as ‘deglobalisation tide’ and coronavirus expose mineral...,China unveils plan for mineral ‘self-sufficiency’ as supply risks multiply,"['In the 2021-25 raw material development plan, Beijing says iron self-sufficiency will be ‘significantly’ increased', 'China will also optimise the annual quota mechanism for the production of rare earth, tungsten and other minerals']",Frank Tang,"China will encourage domestic exploration of iron ore and use more scrap metals to reduce reliance on imports from countries like Australia, while streamlining production quotas for rare earth and tungsten, according to the government. In the 2021-25 raw material development plan, authorities said iron self-sufficiency would be “significantly” increased by lifting the supply of scrap steel to more than 30 per cent of the total, encouraging domestic mining and reducing steelmaking capacity. “The raw material industry is the foundation of the real economy and a basic industry that supports the development of the national economy. It is a key area [for China] to gain international competitive advantages,” said the plan jointly drafted by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Natural Resources. “Such issues, like inadequate safeguards for key strategic resources, need to be resolved urgently.” The risk to industrial and supply chains has been exposed given the deglobalisation tide and the coronavirus pandemic Ministry of Industry and Information Technology China produced 56.7 per cent of global crude steel last year, 41 per cent of refined copper, and remains a global leader making many metals. But its lack of control over upstream mineral resources is an Achilles’ heel for the world’s second largest economy. China imported more than 80 per cent of iron ore requirements last year, about 60 per cent of which was from Australia. The high reliance on overseas steelmaking ingredients poses a severe challenge to the country’s highly-prized economic security. “The risk to industrial and supply chains has been exposed given the deglobalisation tide and the coronavirus pandemic. It’s obviously more difficult to expand to the international market,” said the government. Beijing has long complained about the iron ore pricing mechanism dominated by global miners like Rio Tinto, BHP and Vale. China’s steel industry body demanded an explanation from BHP about the surging cost of iron ore in December last year, before prices went on to reach a record high of US$230 per tonne in May. Despite deteriorating diplomatic ties , Beijing has not made an effort to restrict Australian iron ore imports. “We’ll promote international cooperation in mineral resources, while optimising the structure and distribution of outbound investment,” the government said. “We must improve the ore trading market system and form an open, transparent, fair and reasonable pricing mechanism.” China’s new rare earth merger hands it ‘trump card’ against US Domestic mineral resources are seen as a ballast against unreliable external supply in the new five-year plan. Although Chinese ore is less competitive than products from Australia or Brazil in terms of iron content, mining cost and volume, authorities plan to increase financial support for exploration and use tax incentives to encourage the development of low-grade domestic ores. In a steel industry development guideline released in January, MIIT said China’s self-sufficiency ratio for iron needs to be above 45 per cent by 2025. It set a target for scrap steel output at 300 million metric tonnes annually, equivalent to 30 per cent of national crude steel production. Speaking on Wednesday, Chen Kelong, director of MIIT’s raw material department, said domestic production capacity for crude steel will be slashed over the next five years. The cut was necessary because domestic demand for steel, aluminium, cement and other commodities had peaked, or was nearly there, while steel mills are facing energy and decarbonisation constraints, according to Beijing. The country has removed 150 million metric tonnes of steel production capacity in the past five years, which at the end of 2020 was 1.08 billion metric tonnes, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Meanwhile, China will optimise the annual quota mechanism for production of rare earth, tungsten and other minerals using a “scientific method”, the government document showed. China supplied 58.3 per cent of global rare earth products last year, which are needed in electric vehicles, wind turbines and military equipment. It raised the 2021 mining and smelting quota by 20 per cent to 168,000 metric tonnes and 162,000 metric tonnes, respectively.",2021-12-31T04:30:23+08:00,2021-12-30T18:49:24+08:00,2021-12-31T05:17:36+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3161587/china-vows-greater-iron-ore-self-sufficiency-deglobalisation,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/30/e51eb6b8-c4b8-41fa-8567-9d725f63a0a8_2351bf29.jpg?itok=mBViy70G&v=1640861372,China Economy
"Climate change policies: China sets 2025 deadline for steel, cement, aluminium and output of raw materials...",China sets 2025 deadline for raw materials to meet emissions goals,"['Raw materials must achieve higher quality, better profitability and distribution, with low carbon emissions during the 14th Five-Year Plan period through 2025', 'The plan was issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and two government agencies']",Yujie Xue,"China has introduced a new five-year plan to facilitate the development of the country’s raw materials industry, ordering the sector to make green and digital upgrades to balance supply and demand, and support China’s carbon neutrality goals . The plan, issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and two government agencies on Wednesday, set several targets and laid out the key tasks for the raw materials sector to achieve higher quality, better profitability and distribution, with low carbon emissions during the 14th Five-Year Plan period through 2025. By 2025, the production capacity of major bulk raw material goods such as crude steel and cement should drop or not increase further, according to the plan. The government also ordered the energy consumption per tonne of steel to be reduced by 2 per cent by 2025, while usage per unit of cement should be cut by 3.7 per cent, and electrolytic aluminium is required to use 5 per cent less energy for every unit produced by 2025. “The demand for major bulk raw material products such as steel, electrolytic aluminium, and cement will gradually reach their peaks or plateaus, and the momentum for large-scale demand expansion will tend to weaken,” the plan said. “Facing requirements in energy and resources, as well as the goal of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, the task of green and safe development in the raw material industry is even more urgent. China’s carbon neutral goal needs a lot of heavy lifting by industries China pledged in September 2020 that the country’s total carbon emissions would peak by 2030, and reach carbon neutrality by 2060 . This is also the first time Chinese authorities combined the petrochemical, steel, non-ferrous metals, building materials, as well as new materials sectors together to make such a development plan, according to Chen Kelong, head of raw material industries at MIIT at a Wednesday press conference. The raw materials sector has long served as a foundation for China’s economy. According to MIIT, the added value of the raw material sector accounted for 27.4 per cent of all of China’s above-scale industrial sectors in 2020. Deciphering China’s relationship with coal as it aims for carbon neutrality However, the energy-intensive raw materials sector also has huge environmental impacts on China, which relied heavily on coal to generate about 57 per cent of its annual electricity output last year. As the world’s biggest crude steel consumer and producer, the sector contributed to about 15 per cent of China’s total carbon emissions. The aluminium sector in China also has a serious coal problem, using almost 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity for electrolysis in 2019, among which 430 TWh were generated from coal, according to London-based think tank Ember. To support the country’s carbon neutral goals, the Chinese authorities have taken actions to regulate the raw material sector’s emission problems. In November, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China’s central economic planner, introduced a new set of consumption benchmarks for the nation’s five high energy-consuming industries including steel, cement, and chemicals in the raw materials sector, ordering them to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions. The national emissions trading scheme (ETS), a quota system introduced in China in July to regulate emissions currently among power companies, will also expand its coverage to include companies in steel, non-ferrous metals, chemicals, petrochemicals, building materials later and regulate their carbon emissions. “The plan proposed that by 2025, the proportion of the added value of raw materials sectors in manufacturing should remain stable, this means that the raw material sector will still maintain a certain growth,” said Zhang Ge, a researcher at Citic Futures in a report on Thursday.",2021-12-30T19:15:11+08:00,2021-12-30T16:26:13+08:00,2021-12-30T19:15:11+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3161538/climate-change-policies-china-sets-2025-deadline-steel-cement-aluminium,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/30/d1dd7420-a231-45de-a636-87dd9432ae4e_e9a26a38.jpg?itok=Pepfq0KD&v=1640852774,Business
China-Australia relations: Beijing’s new wool import quota no ‘real improvement’ in trade ties with Canberra,Why China’s new Australian wool quota is no ‘real improvement’ in trade ties,"['Beijing set its 2022 import quota for Australian wool at 40,203 tonnes, up from 38,288 tonnes a year earlier', 'Although positive, it is unlikely to indicate a turnaround in the frayed relationship between the two countries']",Ji Siqi,"Beijing’s decision to raise the import quota for Australian wool next year does not signify a thaw in relations between the two countries, only that China relies on the fibre too much to let it become the “victim of trade tension”. Beijing set its 2022 import quota for Australian wool at 40,203 tonnes, up from 38,288 tonnes a year earlier, according to a statement from the Ministry of Commerce on Wednesday. It is the second time China has boosted the import allowance for Australian wool since diplomatic ties began deteriorating in early 2020, after Canberra pushed for an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic without consulting Beijing. China relies on Australian wool too much. So it would not let wool be the victim of trade tension anyway Agriculture analyst In January, China raised the wool quota to 38,288 tonnes, from 36,465 tonnes last year. Although a positive sign, the move does not necessarily indicate a turnaround in the frayed relationship between the two countries, as the broader significance is undermined by China’s reliance on Australian wool, an agriculture analyst in China said on condition of anonymity. “China relies on Australian wool too much,” the analyst said. “So it would not let wool be the victim of trade tension anyway.” Beijing’s move is also in line with commitments under the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The deal, which came into effect in December 2015, included a clause that China would raise the duty-free, wool-import quota for Australia by 5 per cent each year, until it reaches 44,324 tonnes in 2024. Beijing still has unofficial bans on a variety of Australian products such as coal , log timber, lobsters and cotton, and has imposed anti-dumping duties on wine and barley. “A real improvement in the trade relations between the two countries still depends on products like coal, beef and barley, because China can always choose other sellers over Australia for those products,” the analyst said. China, the world’s largest wool processing country, and Australia, the biggest wool exporter, are mutually dependent when it comes to trade of the fibre. China buys 80 per cent of Australia’s exports each year. Meanwhile, imports from Australia account for around 60 per cent of all wool imports to China, customs data shows. Australian businesses ‘weren’t naive, irresponsible to rely on China trade’ Due to a weaker Australian dollar, the country’s wool has become increasingly competitive in the global market, with Chinese textile makers and wool processors leading the way in purchases, according to a note from research group Australian Wool Innovation earlier this month. “Pre-sale thoughts from the trade pointed to a stronger market, but this was mainly on the back of the weaker [Australian dollar] making wool cheaper in [US dollars],” the note said. “Overseas buyers were looking to lock in some quantity for future delivery as most pre-Lunar New Year deliveries have been made.”",2021-12-30T04:30:35+08:00,2021-12-29T18:21:30+08:00,2021-12-30T11:10:39+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3161436/china-australia-relations-why-chinas-new-australian-wool,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/30/f89919cc-5027-477f-8793-3631ce354098_45ccd5d5.jpg?itok=PFTBAqt5&v=1640827766,China Economy
China food security: vow to boost 2022 soybean output sets stage for leap in GM seed tech,China’s vow to boost soybean output sets stage for jump in GM seed tech,"['China’s top leadership wants to improve seeds and per unit yield in its bid to secure domestic grain supply', 'To boost self-sufficiency, China’s seed industry is facing a new round of reshuffling and industrial concentration']",Frank Tang,"China’s efforts to lift domestic production of soybeans and other oil crops could accelerate the approval of genetically modified (GM) seeds and shake up the seed industry, analysts said. At the weekend’s central rural work conference, China’s top leadership pledged to keep people’s rice bowls filled with domestic grain, setting a 2022 production target at least equivalent to this year’s 650 million metric tonnes. “The general consideration next year is to stabilise domestic grain supplies and corn output, while expanding soybean and oil crop production,” agriculture minister Tang Renjian said in an interview with the official Economic Daily on Monday. The Chinese government will extend corn-soybean strip intercropping, which utilises farmland most efficiently and can facilitate mechanisation. But the biggest growth potential will be from the improvement of seeds and per unit yield, he said. Panic buying in China, but is there a food security concern? “There are still relatively large gaps with developed countries in terms of per unit yield of corn, soybeans and other varieties.” China is the world’s largest buyer of agricultural products from soybeans and corn, to rapeseed and palm oil. But the country’s vulnerability has been exposed amid trade tensions with major suppliers such as the United States and global farm commodity price hikes. “The soybean trade, for instance, is closely related to political factors and diplomatic relations,” analyst Tian Yaxiong, from China Futures Co, said in a research note. “Reducing [foreign] dependence can help regain initiative in trade negotiations.” China has proposed an overhaul of regulations governing GM crops , in a move that is likely to strengthen the nation’s seed industry amid heightened food security concerns. The agriculture ministry issued two draft documents in November detailing planned changes such as easing trial requirements for authorised GM crops, revising safety evaluations for genetically modified organisms used in agriculture, encouraging companies and institutions to build their own research bases, and relaxing geographic restrictions on test areas. Beijing’s endeavours to improve the resilience of grain supply is in direct response to changes in global trade. But there is still work to do, according to analysts. “There could be more policy support for the northeastern regions in China to grow oil crops,” Tian said. As part of the Trump administration’s trade war , Beijing was asked frequently to buy more American soybeans as the former president tried to win votes in agricultural states. China’s 2020 purchases of US soybeans rose 39.3 per cent from a year earlier to 23.6 metric tonnes, Chinese customs data showed. Still, China’s imports of US agricultural products remain well below the targets agreed to under the phase one deal. China’s Xi Jinping puts focus back on food security Overall, the world’s second largest economy imports about 20 per cent of its edible oil requirements, with a particularly high dependence on foreign palm oil and soybeans. The total estimated area planted with soybeans is growing, however. Some 9.35 million hectares were planted with soybeans in 2019, up from 6.8 million hectares in 2014, according to China Agricultural Information Net, an affiliate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Domestic output of 18.1 million metric tonnes was still much lower than imports of 98.5 million metric tonnes in the same year. The area used for soybeans is estimated to be 8.4 million hectares this year, while production is projected to be 16.4 million metric tonnes. Guo Haiyan and Sun Yang, analysts from China International Capital Corp (CICC), said security in feed grains remains poor and there is a large gap between domestic output and demand for some crops. The commercialisation of genetically modified seed production for corn and soybeans is now gradually unfolding Guo Haiyan and Sun Yang But China’s seed industry is facing a new round of reshuffling and industrial concentration. “The commercialisation of genetically modified seed production for corn and soybeans is now gradually unfolding,” the CICC analysts said. In addition to maintaining total arable land of 120 million hectares, the work conference vowed to turn 66.7 million hectares of it into high-grade farmland free from flooding and drought. Beijing is also putting more pressure on local officials, linking grain production to their job performance appraisals from next year. The government will use a minimum purchase price, subsidies and agricultural insurance to prevent losses among farmers, while trying to raise their incomes by providing additional services such as plant-upon-order, logistics and marketing. “The job market for migrant workers may become more severe next year,” the agriculture minister said, citing the pandemic and macroeconomic situation. About 183 million farmers left their hometowns to work at the end of September, an increase of 2 per cent from a year earlier, government data showed. “We will take multiple measures to increase farmers’ income … and resolutely prevent a large-scale return of poverty.”",2021-12-27T22:00:18+08:00,2021-12-27T17:45:33+08:00,2021-12-27T23:24:04+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3161179/china-food-security-vow-boost-2022-soybean-output-sets-stage,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/27/1f184cef-2026-4fe0-b015-62b9da30f048_0bbd5f1b.jpg?itok=5kGHXIhy&v=1640618645,China Economy
China’s new rare earth merger hands it ‘trump card’ in global fight for resources,China’s new rare earth merger hands it ‘trump card’ against US,"['Merger of some of China’s top rare earth producers into a new company under the state assets regulator gives it a strategic advantage, experts say', 'Some hardliners have urged Beijing to weaponise its dominance in rare earth production after the Trump administration started a trade war in 2018']",Frank Tang,"China’s move to set up a global force in the strategic rare earth sector could help it pre-empt and respond to future external challenges, including trade tensions with the United States, analysts say. The China Rare Earth Group was formed after the merger of units from the Aluminium Corporation of China, China Minmetals, Ganzhou Rare Earth Group and two rare earth technology developers, the state assets watchdog said on Wednesday. Analysts believe the consolidation will help maintain the country’s global competitiveness and give it a trump card to play in conflict with the US, though many warned it should be careful not to overplay its hand. Rare earth is composed of 15 elements and are vital components in smart electronic devices, wind turbines, electric cars and military equipment. China’s dominance of rare earths supply is a concern in the West The merger is the largest of its kind in the world. Based on 2021 data, the group will have 52,719 metric tonnes of mining quota, or 31 per cent of the national total, and 47,129 metric tonnes of smelting quota, or 29 per cent of China’s total. It accounts for about 62 per cent of heavy rare earth supplies nationally. “This round of consolidation will further increase industrial concentration, helping forge a trump card in global resource competition,” said Galaxy Securities analyst Yan Yulu. Rare earth is one of only a few resources in which China enjoys market dominance , contrasting sharply with its reliance on oil imports from the Middle East and iron ore from Australia. Former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who opened the country to the world four decades ago, once compared China’s control of rare earth to the Middle East’s dominance of crude oil supply. “Considering the global geopolitical tension and intensified competition for resources, such a move will enhance domestic control,” Yan wrote in a research note on Thursday. It will let rare earth reflect its true value, and build China’s strategic advantages Yan Yulu “It will let rare earth reflect its true value, and build China’s strategic advantages. It is in line with the country’s best interests.” Li Jin, chief researcher with the China Enterprise Research Institute, said consolidation was necessary because China’s production dominance did not not guarantee it a say in pricing, attributing that to the weakness in downstream technologies. The average export price of rare earths jumped 36 per cent from a year ago in November and doubled from the start of 2020 to US$13,200, customs data showed. “Previous consolidation into six groups failed to solve such issues like homogeneous domestic competition and the technological gap with foreign peers in terms of downstream sectors,” said Li. “China needs an industry leader to participate in international competition.” There are still other major state-owned players in China, including China Northern Rare Earth Group, Xiamen Tungsten and Guangdong Rare Earth Group. Internationally, China’s market dominance has been weakened in the past several years. Its share of global output has fallen from 86 per cent in 2014 to 58.3 per cent last year, according to the US Geological Survey. It boasted 36.7 per cent of global reserves in 2020, ahead of Vietnam and Brazil’s 18 per cent. The US raised its rare earth output by 36 per cent last year to 38,000 metric tonnes. Some hardliners have urged Beijing to weaponsize rare earth after the Trump administration started a trade war that imposed heavy tariffs on most Chinese products in 2018. An export ban was used when relations with Japan deteriorated in 2011, driving their price up by more than tenfold and resulting in a joint complaint of the US, European Union and Japan at the World Trade Organization. Li said market dominance in rare earth is a trump card that could be played in the rivalry with Washington. “But we should refrain from using it temporarily. It’s not the right time,” he said. China exported 44,830 metric tonnes of rare earth in the first 11 months of this year, up 43.3 per cent year on year, according to data from the General Administration of Customs.",2021-12-24T20:30:18+08:00,2021-12-24T17:40:47+08:00,2021-12-24T20:54:26+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3160995/chinas-new-rare-earth-merger-hands-it-trump-card-global-fight,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/24/bd05ae22-deb5-4e44-b71b-379dd89f423e_ef0ccf8d.jpg?itok=zuuvSnVV&v=1640338853,China Economy
China forms rare earths giant to protect its dominance in global output as market share falls,China forms rare earths giant to protect global market dominance,"['The China Rare Earth Group may help tighten China’s control over the internationally strategic minerals, analysts said', 'It was formed via the merger of units under Aluminium Corporation of China (Chinalco), China Minmetals Corporation and Ganzhou Rare Earth Group']",Eric Ng,"Beijing has set up an industry-leading rare earth giant in a bid to bolster China’s dominance of global production as it comes under threat from rising output elsewhere. The move will enhance the sector’s long-term sustainability and competitiveness, and tighten China’s grip over the pricing and production of the internationally strategic minerals, analysts said. The newly formed China Rare Earth Group will control more than a third of mainland China’s rare earths mining industry. Its formation via the merger of units under state-owned Aluminium Corporation of China (Chinalco), China Minmetals Corporation and Ganzhou Rare Earth Group has been approved by the State Council, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission said in a statement on Wednesday. “After this restructuring, our controlling shareholder will be changed from China Minmetals Corporation to the newly formed group,” China Minmetals Rare Earth said in a filing to Shenzhen’s stock exchange on Thursday. The formation of China Rare Earth Group will help speed up the more sustainable development of the ion-absorbed type of rare earth ore found in southern China, and support investment in new technologies for separating and processing it into higher value products, China Central Television reported. After the merger, China Rare Earth Group will own resources in the provinces of Jiangxi, Shandong, Sichuan and Hunan, as well as the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, according to a China Galaxy Securities report late in September. It will control 37.6 per cent of China’s rare earths mining – including a close to 70 per cent share for heavy rare earths – and almost 42 per cent of the national ore separation and processing volume, the brokerage noted. “Amid surging rare earth prices and tightening control of the resource by various countries, rare earth may become a strategic tool for China to wield international influence,” said China Galaxy analyst Hua Li in the report. Heavy rare earths – such as dysprosium used in nuclear reactors – commonly found in southern China are more limited in supply and more valuable than northern China’s light rare earths like praseodymium and neodymium that are used in electric cars and wind turbine magnets. Rare earth prices, as tracked by a composite index compiled by the Association of China Rare Earth Industry, have gained 88 per cent in the past year. In the last three decades, China has invested heavily in facilities that carry out the lion’s share of global rare earth mining and ore processing work. The process of extracting the ore is detrimental to the environment. But the United States – the world’s largest producer in the 1980s – ramped up its output by 36 per cent last year to 38,000 tonnes as the metals’ strategic value has grown. Rare earth minerals are vital components in the production of smart electronic devices, wind turbines, electric cars and military equipment. Myanmar raised it production by 20 per cent to 30,000 tonnes last year, while Madagascar doubled its output to 8,000 tonnes. China’s production grew 6 per cent to 140,000 tonnes. China’s share of global output has slipped from 86 per cent in 2014 to to 58.3 per cent last year, according to the US Geological Survey.

China’s rising coal power output to push global electricity generated from fossil fuel to record high this...,China’s rising coal power output hurting decarbonisation efforts: IEA,"['Global power generation from coal is also expected to jump by 9 per cent this year to an all-time high of 10,350 terawatt-hours, according to the IEA', 'This year’s record level of coal power generation shows how far off track the world is in its efforts to put emissions into decline towards net zero, IEA’s Fatih Birol says']",Martin Choi,"China’s coal power output – around half the global total – is expected to grow by 9 per cent this year, undermining efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. Global power generation from coal is also expected to jump by 9 per cent this year to an all-time high of 10,350 terawatt-hours, after falling in 2019 and 2020, potentially putting demand for the fossil fuel on course to reach a record high next year, according to the IEA’s Coal 2021 report released on Friday. “Coal is the single largest source of global carbon emissions, and this year’s historically high level of coal power generation is a worrying sign of how far off track the world is in its efforts to put emissions into decline towards net zero,” said Fatih Birol, executive director at IEA. “Without strong and immediate actions by governments to tackle coal emissions – in a way that is fair, affordable and secure for those affected – we will have little chance, if any at all, of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.” At the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow last month, global leaders urged greater efforts to reduce the use of coal power and phase out fossil fuel subsidies. Over 190 countries agreed to reducing emissions to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees and ideally 1.5 degrees by 2100 from pre-industrial levels. However, the average global temperature last year was already 1.2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, according to the World Meteorological Organisation. The rebound in global coal power generation was driven by the rapid economic recovery this year, which pushed up electricity demand much faster than low-carbon supplies could keep up. China’s power generation, including district heating, accounts for one-third of global coal consumption, while the country’s coal use is more than half of the world total, according to the IEA. Overall coal demand worldwide, including uses beyond power generation such as cement and steel production, is forecast to grow by 6 per cent in 2021, according to the IEA. While the increase will not take demand above the record levels it reached in 2013 and 2014, overall coal demand could reach all-time highs as soon as 2022, depending on weather patterns and economic growth, and remain at that level for the following two years, underscoring the need to fast and strong policy action, the IEA said. China should stop building more coal power plants Despite China’s coal shortage and the corresponding implications for industrial production and electricity demand, the country’s coal consumption is expected to increase by 4 per cent to 4.13 billion tonnes in 2021, surpassing the record high in 2013, the report said. China’s coal consumption is forecast to reach 4.27 billion tonnes in 2024, increasing by 1.1 per cent per year on average, to satisfy its power sector needs. The country will still have to rely on coal and to a lesser extent gas to keep pace with the country’s rising electricity demand, despite the expansion of its nuclear and renewable energy capacities, the IEA added. China’s electricity demand growth is estimated at 10 per cent for 2021, reflecting the country’s “strong economy recovery as well as a cold snap in the north and a warmer-than-average summer”, according to the report. “The pledges to reach net zero emissions made by many countries, including China and India, should have very strong implications for coal – but these are not yet visible in our near-term forecast, reflecting the major gap between ambitions and action,” said Keisuke Sadamori, director of energy markets and security at the IEA. “Asia dominates the global coal market, with China and India accounting for two-thirds of overall demand. These two economies – dependent on coal and with a combined population of almost 3 billion people – hold the key to future coal demand.” Beijing announced last September that it would try and reach peak emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2060 . India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged at the COP26 summit that the world’s third-biggest emitter would reach net-zero by 2070 . “Coal power will inevitably begin to decline soon: China has committed to phasing down coal from 2025, while India’s huge renewables target should remove the need for more coal,” said Dave Jones, global programme lead at energy think tank Ember. “It will take time for the ship to turn, but time is not on our side to keep 1.5 degrees within reach,” he added.",2021-12-17T16:44:23+08:00,2021-12-17T16:36:16+08:00,2021-12-17T16:44:23+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3160121/chinas-rising-coal-power-output-push-global-electricity,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/17/bb421882-0518-4892-9a26-5a6fe70b09bf_ba996d29.jpg?itok=xWkOXqtC&v=1639730177,China Business
"China’s diesel exports set to climb after averting supply crisis, domestic stock ‘to build over winter’",China’s diesel exports set to climb after averting supply crisis,"['China National Petroleum Corporation and China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation, better known as Sinopec, started boosting production in September', 'Refiners now have a surplus of diesel that can be shipped to international markets']",Bloomberg,"China has averted a full-scale diesel crisis after refiners quickly ramped up production, with excess supply poised to flow into a regional market starved of the industrial fuel. Top processors China National Petroleum Corporation and China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation, better known as Sinopec, started boosting production in September under government coordination as demand surged following a broader energy crunch. While some fuel retailers were forced to ration diesel volumes and at least one refiner imported the fuel to meet rising consumption, the nation’s output rebounded in October to the highest level in 13 months. Refiners now have a surplus of diesel that can be shipped to international markets. Supply tightness has largely subsided with hiked production and declining domestic demand. We expect domestic inventories to build over winter Mia Geng China had retreated from the export market to conserve its domestic supplies, which left consumers turning to India and South Korea to meet their needs as economies rebounded from the coronavirus pandemic. “Supply tightness has largely subsided with hiked production and declining domestic demand,” said Mia Geng, an analyst at industry consultant FGE. “We expect domestic inventories to build over winter.” Diesel consumption had surged since September due to seasonal factors such as more demand from the fishing industry and for crop harvesting, while an energy crunch after natural gas and coal shortages led to greater use of the fuel in power generation. Demand has since eased and domestic stockpiles are expanding. OilChem estimated inventories held at independent refineries, fuel traders and state-owned sales companies were at a seven-week high on Friday. China’s state refiners will export 210,000 tonnes of diesel in December, according to JLC. Surging diesel prices drive some Chinese truckers to the black market While that is 86 per cent less than the same period a year ago, it is believed some plants had halted exports in November, the industry consultant said. Vortexa forecast overseas shipments were trending at 55,000 barrels a day last month, which would be the lowest level since January 2015. The resumption of China’s diesel exports could be another bearish factor for refining margins in Singapore, a proxy for Asia. Margins are back below double figures after a new variant of the coronavirus raised concerns about global demand. They were as high as US$16.20 a barrel in mid-October. “China may increase diesel exports from minimum levels seen in November, but export levels will continue to face downward pressure, mainly due to policy constraints in the form of export quota limits,” said Fenglei Shi, associate director of oil markets at IHS Markit.",2021-12-01T10:44:38+08:00,2021-12-01T10:44:28+08:00,2021-12-01T10:44:38+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3157967/chinas-diesel-exports-set-climb-after-averting-supply-crisis,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/01/7fe9d5e4-2bee-4a9f-89bb-8f6cd1b686de_ee53d08e.jpg?itok=Nhee7mCu&v=1638326677,China Economy
China coal: Beijing blasts coal index providers as it moves to keep price within ‘reasonable range’,Beijing blasts coal index providers that ‘misguided the market’,"['Nation’s supply of thermal coal has increased by more than 30 per cent since October, according to the state economic planner, but price remains relatively high', 'NDRC says it consulted power companies for advice on setting the pricing range for coal to restrict wild fluctuations']",Ji Siqi,"Beijing is taking steps to tighten its regulations over China’s coal market amid ongoing concerns over a power shortage and rising factory-gate inflation. The nation’s top economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), recently held meetings with coal-fired power companies and economic and legal experts, soliciting suggestions for a long-term pricing mechanism. The commission first mentioned the mechanism last month, saying it was intended to keep coal-price fluctuations within a “reasonable range”. On Friday, the NDRC said representatives from the consulted power plants offered advice on what that “reasonable range” should be at key mines and ports. Everything you should know about China’s power crisis The planner also disclosed the preliminary results of a probe into the nation’s 12 coal index providers, in a bid to tame runaway coal prices. It revealed that some of the providers were found to have violated rules, and the penalties could include seeing their index publications suspended, being added to credit blacklists, or even being subjected to legal action. “[Some indices] misguided the market, and to some extent this led to coal prices deviating from the fundamentals of supply and demand,” the NDRC said earlier this week. The planner also noted that some of the consulted experts suggested that mid- to long-term purchasing contracts should be encouraged for coal companies, power plants and powers users, while a coal-electricity price linkage mechanism could be established in the contracts between electricity companies and users. In 2017, China determined that the “reasonable range” for the price of coal was between 500 yuan (US$78) and 570 yuan per tonne. Last month, however, the price surged to around 2,000 yuan per tonne, due to a severe shortage. The price started to decline when authorities moved to boost coal output . As soaring market-driven coal prices clashed with government-controlled electricity rates , power plants became less inclined to produce sufficient power to meet demand. This led to widespread electricity rationing in more than half of China’s provinces from September to October. An employee with the northeast branch of the State Grid – China’s state-owned utility corporation – told the Post last month that power plants in Liaoning province, where the power crisis was severe, were losing more than 0.1 yuan (1.6 US cents) for every kilowatt of electricity generated. Since the government’s intervention, the coal shortage has gradually eased. The nation’s supply of thermal coal has increased by more than 30 per cent since October, compared with the same period last year, and the coal storage in power plants nationwide reached 147 million tonnes as of Tuesday, according to the NDRC. “It is expected that the coal storage in power plants at the end of November may exceed the same period last year, reaching a historical high,” it said. Coal industry insiders blame Beijing for China’s ‘man-made’ power crisis But the price of thermal coal this week remained relatively high, at around 900 yuan per tonne. Weak demand and a strong supply will drag prices down in the coming months, according to a report released on Thursday by the China Coal Transportation and Distribution Association, an industry group. It added that China’s “ dual control plan ”, which aims to control high energy consumption and high emission projects, is likely to continue dampening the industrial demand for coal. “Given the usual year-end production restrictions [on heavy industries] to ensure [workers’] safety, and with the Winter Olympics approaching, coal demand in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the surrounding areas will be further suppressed,” the report said.",2021-11-26T21:30:28+08:00,2021-11-26T20:01:39+08:00,2021-11-26T21:30:28+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3157552/china-coal-beijing-blasts-coal-index-providers-it-moves-keep,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/26/fff445ce-991d-4ab6-9807-ce73cf956716_a970346d.jpg?itok=0Fn33YZ2&v=1637928106,China Economy
Why US-China oil reserve release won’t fix deeper demand-supply problems,US-China oil reserve release won’t fix deeper demand-supply problems,,Neal Kimberley,"Releasing oil from strategic reserves to take some heat out the recent upsurge in crude prices might make economic and political sense in both China and the United States. But it is nothing more than a quick fix and does not address the fundamental supply flow problems that have been driving up the oil price. As the world’s biggest oil importer, China should arguably also be a little cautious about how far it goes down this path. The US can draw from its strategic petroleum reserve knowing it has ample sources of domestic shale energy and offshore oil to tap if needed. China does not have access to that scale of domestic hydrocarbon resources, which goes a long way to explaining why Beijing retains a substantial strategic petroleum reserve in the first place. After all, there’s a reason it’s called a “strategic” reserve. Admittedly, given Beijing’s prioritisation of the need to lower energy prices in China , it makes good sense for policymakers to respond positively to the suggestion aired at last week’s virtual meeting between Presidents Xi Jinping and Joe Biden , that a coordinated release of oil from the two countries’ strategic reserves now would be useful in pushing down the price of crude. It is also an opportunity for Xi to prove that there are issues where China-US cooperation can result in a win-win scenario, especially given the increasing pressure the Biden administration has been coming under as a consequence of US petrol price rises . But the idea that such action is anything other than a temporary fix for the mismatch between oil demand and supply is misplaced. In the first place, and just looking at China’s situation where energy security is always a key issue, any drawdown from its stock of strategic reserves will have to be replenished, with every likelihood that policymakers would want that to happen sooner rather than later. That replenishment will have to come through buying more crude from the major producers, such as the oil-producers’ cartel Opec and its allies, known as Opec+. China’s energy crunch and the high economic costs of going green Yet Opec+ has been reluctant – or perhaps unable – to increase production, which has helped drive crude prices ever higher amid a rebound in energy demand as the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has started to recede. Unless there is enough of an uptick in oil production to allow China to replenish its reserves at a reasonable price (and that seems unlikely in the next few quarters), Beijing might be left with the unpalatable options of either delaying the replenishment or paying over the odds for crude oil and, in the process, disturbing the lower price equilibrium that the initial reserve drawdown was intended to help establish. Either way, the structural problems that impede the raising of global oil production to meet worldwide demand would remain unresolved. To mitigate climate change , the world needs a global economy that runs off renewable energy rather than hydrocarbons. In pursuit of that goal, investors and financial institutions are increasingly incorporating environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors in their decision-making. This ESG emphasis encourages the financing of renewable energy projects but also makes borrowing to fund new hydrocarbon extraction less accessible and costlier. Additionally, and this is arguably a particular problem for US shale, aside from a high oil price, there is little long-term incentive for private energy companies to pour money into new hydrocarbon projects when the world is determinedly moving away from reliance on such fuel sources. China’s coal crisis exposes the hypocrisy of the West’s carbon footprint But, in the absence of a global energy network that is based on renewables, the world still needs a plentiful supply of oil and gas. Indeed, to build that renewable network, the world will have to use an awful lot of hydrocarbons. Yet the financing drive towards renewable energy leaves the hydrocarbon sector underinvested. This combination of factors will inevitably affect oil supply and keep upwards pressure on crude prices , and a one-off China-US oil reserve release will have only a passing effect. Beijing and Washington might both conclude that a strategic petroleum reserve drawdown right now would be well timed to put downward pressure on the price of oil, but that’s just a quick fix. The fundamental problems affecting global crude production remain unaddressed.

China calls for global cooperation to improve energy supplies as power prices surge across the world,China calls for ‘coordinated action’ to tackle global energy crunch,"['Ren Hongbin, China’s assistant commerce minister, says countries should ‘strengthen policy coordination’ to steady volatile energy prices', 'China, which relies on coal to keep its economy running, has been gripped by one of its worst power crises ever since September']",Amanda Lee,"China wants to see more international cooperation to stabilise power prices and boost the global energy trade, the nation’s assistant commerce minister has said, as the world’s No 2 economy looks to steady domestic supply after weeks of disruptions. Market volatility had increased as a result of global energy shortages driven by a sharp uptick in post-pandemic demand and extreme weather, Ren Hongbin said. Slow investment in energy projects due to earlier forecasts of low oil and gas prices have exacerbated the power crisis, Ren was quoted as saying by the Paper.cn at the 10th China International Oil and Gas Trade Congress in Shanghai on Monday. “It is hoped that the energy industries of various countries will take coordinated action to promote global energy trade, investment and production capacity coordination, jointly maintain the stability of the energy market, and to boost sustained recovery and growth of the world,” the minister said. To a certain extent, national energy security requires international trade to facilitate Luo Yizhou To steady prices, Ren said countries should “strengthen policy coordination” and “balance new energy and traditional energy”. Speaking at the same event, Luo Yizhou, deputy general manager of PetroChina International, acknowledged the importance of multilateral cooperation in China’s long-term energy security. “To a certain extent, national energy security requires international trade to facilitate,” Luo was quoted as saying. Global energy prices surged in the third quarter of this year, with spot prices for natural gas more than quadrupling to record levels in Europe and Asia compared to last year, and the ripple effects being felt in markets for commodities like coal and oil, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). “Our expectation is that these prices will revert to more normal levels early next year when heating demand ebbs and supplies adjust. However, if prices stay high as they have been, this could begin to be a drag on global growth,” the IMF said in a blog post on October 21. China, which relies on coal to keep its economy running, has been gripped by one of its worst power crises in years amid domestic shortages for the fossil fuel. Though there are signs the crisis is easing , businesses and residents have had to grapple with nationwide power rationing and blackouts since September. High coal prices also sent China’s producer price index , which reflects the prices factories charge wholesalers for their products, to their highest point since 1995 in October at 13.5 per cent, compared to 10.7 per cent in September, squeezing profit margins of many small to medium sized manufacturers. The power crisis prompted Beijing to liberalise the state-controlled electricity pricing mechanism to alleviate operating difficulties for coal-fired power companies. The government also reversed a decision to curb coal production by ordering domestic miners to pump up output. China’s top economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said on Tuesday coal production had increased steadily since November, after hitting 60 million tonnes in October, a year on year increase of 4 per cent. Meng Wei, a spokeswoman for the NDRC, said the economic planner would continue to “supervise and urge coal mines” to increase production capacity, while working with relevant departments to ensure supply and price stability. China’s power crisis ‘man-made’, and miscalculations by Beijing serve as ‘a very painful lesson’ China has also been importing more coal, oil and gas to ease its power crunch. In the first three quarters of the year, crude oil and natural gas imports increased by 32.4 per cent and 39.8 per cent, respectively, while October coal imports almost doubled by volume from a year ago to 26.9 million tonnes, according to customs data. “Import demand for energy-related commodities should stay strong as China is likely to continue to face energy shortages through the winter,” said Oxford Economics in a research note last week. In a forecast late last month, the World Bank said energy prices would be on average more than 80 per cent higher in 2021 than last year. There were also risks of additional price spikes in the near-term, amid very low inventories and persistent supply bottlenecks.",2021-11-16T18:15:14+08:00,2021-11-16T17:57:04+08:00,2021-11-16T22:52:17+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3156256/china-calls-global-cooperation-improve-energy-supplies-power,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/11/16/82e75d9e-46b0-11ec-88c2-0bacf4eabd5b_image_hires_181521.jpeg?itok=F7cusvuM&v=1637057732,China Economy
"China’s consumption growth surprises analysts, and outlook for exports and property market remains uncertain","As China’s consumption surprises, Beijing warns of ‘instability and uncertainty’","['China’s economy had staged an impressive recovery from the impact of the coronavirus until numerous headwinds began taking their toll on economic growth', 'NBS official tells the Post that official database was recently updated with more historical data ‘to promote openness and transparency of statistics’']",Orange Wang,"China’s economy showed signs of stabilising in October as retail sales and industrial production bounced back from the previous month and beat expectations, but officials and experts are warning of a bleak outlook in the recovery due to pandemic uncertainties and global supply-chain issues. Sporadic outbreaks of Covid-19 have dampened economic momentum, said Sheana Yue, an assistant economist with Capital Economics. As the outbreaks continue, movements will continue to be limited, and consumption growth will remain slow. However, “any near-term virus-linked disruptions should prove temporary”, Yue added. Yue also warned that the current strength of China’s exports is unlikely to be sustainable over the coming year, as global consumption patterns normalise coming out of the pandemic, and as backlogs of orders are gradually cleared. China’s exports have been defying expectations and warnings of a slowdown, but data has shown that while export values have increased, the volumes of many goods have not. Her assessment came after the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday spoke of growing “positive factors” in China’s economic recovery. “However, it should also be noted that there are still many factors of international instability and uncertainty,” NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said. “There are still constraints on the recovery of the domestic economy, and the upwards cost pressure on enterprises is increasing.” Meanwhile, the statistics agency attempted to placate concerns over skyrocketing factory inflation, which saw the producer price index (PPI) rise to 13.5 per cent in October from 10.7 per cent in September. Another NBS official also confirmed to the South China Morning Post that the official database had recently been updated with more historical data. Data before October 1996 had been unavailable until the update pushed the available records back to January 1993. Given the update, the PPI reading for October was a 26-year high – the highest since July 1995, rather than an all-time high. The NBS official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said: “The change is to promote openness and transparency of statistics,” while noting that the PPI statistic was first compiled in 1993. “The general trend is like that, as long as the data can be made public, we will add as much as possible,” she said, suggesting that the practice was likely to extend to other indicators. How important are small firms to China's economy, and what challenges are they facing? The NBS also said that retail sales – a key gauge of consumer spending in the world’s most populous nation – grew by 4.9 per cent in October compared with a year earlier, up from the 4.4 per cent increase in September and beating analysts’ expectations in a Bloomberg survey. And industrial production, a gauge of activity in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors, grew by 3.5 per cent in October from a year earlier, after a 3.1 per cent gain in September. Meanwhile, growth of fixed-asset investment – a gauge of expenditure on items including infrastructure, property, machinery and equipment – remained weak. It rose by 6.1 per cent in the January-October period, compared with a year earlier, and was down from a rise of 7.3 per cent in the first three quarters. NBS data also showed that property investment and sales growth remained sluggish over the January-October period, and Yue at Capital Economics expects the property downturn to deepen further as developers continue to cut back on new projects in response to weaker demand and growing financial strains. China’s crackdown on education, property leave wealthy in crisis mode China’s economy had staged an impressive recovery from the impact of the coronavirus, but faced with numerous headwinds, including a property slump, power crisis , weak consumer sentiment and soaring raw material costs , its economic growth slowed to 4.9 per cent in the third quarter. Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, expects the central government to unveil measures to beef up investment. “We think macro policies are close to a turning point,” Zhang said. “We expect the government to boost fiscal spending around the year’s end to stabilise the weakening trend in investment.” The NBS’s Fu also said that some major projects in the nation’s 14th five-year plan are already under way, and that there has been an increase in the issuance of government special-purpose bonds , helping boost infrastructure investment growth. At Monday’s press conference, Fu also noted that the imported impact of rising international commodity prices, along with the tight supply of some domestic energy and raw material products, have led to a higher increase in PPI. “It seems to show some signs of stagflation, but on the whole, this should be a transitory situation caused by some short-term impact factors,” Fu said. The surveyed jobless rate, an imperfect measurement of unemployment in China, stood at 4.9 per cent in October, unchanged from September, the NBS data showed. China set a target of creating 11 million new urban jobs and a surveyed urban unemployment rate of 5.5 per cent for this year. According to the data, China created 11.33 million jobs in the first 10 months of the year.",2021-11-15T22:15:18+08:00,2021-11-15T18:44:11+08:00,2021-11-16T12:55:12+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3156130/chinas-consumption-growth-surprises-analysts-and-outlook,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/11/16/73a8ae56-4600-11ec-88c2-0bacf4eabd5b_image_hires_125510.jpeg?itok=h6y6cJI3&v=1637038521,China Economy
Chinese producers pass on high raw material costs as inflation risks grow,What rising paint prices tells us about China’s inflation risks,"['The price of titanium dioxide, a key ingredient in paint and coatings, has jumped as producer price inflation has increased in China', 'There are now signs upstream producers may be passing rising raw material costs downstream to smaller businesses and consumers']",Jess Ma,"The price in China for titanium dioxide, a key ingredient in paint, has surged along with industrial metals and coal in recent weeks, showing how production inflation is rippling through the world’s No 2 economy. In mid-October, several Chinese paint companies posted notices online that prices for domestic and industrial paints, along with construction products that rely on them, would increase by 40 per cent. The culprit behind the price hikes is titanium dioxide, a key ingredient in making paint and coatings. Prices for the pigment, which comes in powder form, have surged by more than 50 per cent since February due to growing industrial activity in China, analysts say. Recent power rationing , brought on in part by a shortage of thermal coal, has delivered another blow to the sector and to Chinese manufacturing across the board. What remains to be seen is whether the energy supply can stabilise in the coming months Thomas Kavanagh Thomas Kavanagh, associate editor at commodities analyst Argus Media, said the power crisis is set to affect all parts of the titanium supply chain. “A return to ‘normal’ could see some whipsaw effects across the titanium supply chain, so I see no way of avoiding short to medium-term price volatility because disruption to the market has already occurred, ” he said. “What remains to be seen is whether the energy supply can stabilise in the coming months. If it does, producers and downstream consumers will have an easier time rebalancing the supply chain. If not, expect further price fluctuations and volatility in 2022.” The recent power cuts, while easing , have fuelled China’s producer price inflation. New data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday showed factory-gate prices rose to the highest level in 26 years in October. Can China really kick its coal addiction to achieve its 2060 carbon neutral target? There are now signs upstream producers in China may have started passing on rising costs to downstream businesses and consumers, although the increase in consumer price inflation last month to 1.5 per cent from a year earlier was still lower than the annual target Beijing set at 3 per cent. Due to power shortages, the production of titanium slag – a raw form of titanium used to make titanium dioxide – fell. Titanium slag prices rose by 1,000 yuan (US$156) within two days to between 9,000 and 9,300 yuan per tonne at the end of October, Argus Media said in a note. Major production firm Citic Titanium also raised slag prices for November by 1,182 yuan. As a result, production of titanium dioxide has suffered in China. Producers of titanium dioxide in Guangxi autonomous region told metals analyst SMM in October that ongoing power rationing and uncertainty concerning production restrictions would hurt operations. LB Group, one of China‘s biggest titanium dioxide makers, said in August operational expenses for production have increased 44.82 per cent compared to last year. The impact has flowed down the supply chain. Paint company AkzoNobel said it had budgeted for higher costs, although its sales have continued to grow despite facing a backlog of orders. An employee at another large paint company, who did not want to be named, told the South China Morning Post the firm was lucky to stock up before prices went up. Many smaller businesses declined to comment about the situation, but a few confirmed prices have jumped for titanium dioxide-based products they use.

China’s surging diesel prices ripple across logistics supply chain ahead of Singles’ Day shopping holiday,Surging diesel prices drive some Chinese truckers to the black market,"['Diesel prices in China have hit 8,023.2 yuan (US$1,254) per tonne in the second half of the year, marking 64.4 per cent year-on-year growth', 'The rising price of diesel has come at a critical time for the logistics industry ahead of peak shopping and delivery season']",Ji Siqi,"In recent weeks, truck driver Wang Ping has started changing the route of his regular 5,000km (3,100 miles) round trip from the central Chinese province of Hubei to the Pearl River Delta in the south. With the price of diesel now above 7.2 yuan (US$1.125) per litre from 5 yuan earlier this year, Wang has been making new stops to meet with illicit fuel sellers because he can no longer afford to fill his 49-tonne truck at regular petrol stations. Diesel prices in China hit 8,023.2 yuan (US$1,254) per tonne in the second half of October, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, marking 64.4 per cent year-on-year growth. The sharp increase in prices has come at a critical time for the logistics industry ahead of peak shopping and delivery season. China’s Singles’ Day, which is the world’s largest online shopping festival, had kicked off and drivers face earnings pressures when their expenses rise. Already suffering a low wage, Wang – who is one of China’s army of 30 million truck drivers – has seen his take home pay slashed on top of a rise in toll fees this year. “It means I would lose 1,000 yuan in a single trip instead of making any money,” Wang said. “We also stay off the motorway to save money for the fuel and toll fees, but that means we drive [on smaller roads] causing more fatigue and safety risks on the way.” Diesel is now more expensive because the cost of crude oil – from which diesel is derived – has shot up with the world’s industrial recovery, and due to new demand for it as an alternative fuel amid China’s recent power crunch. In some parts of the country, the tight diesel supply has even resulted in fuel rationing. As a result, more drivers are choosing to reduce the number of trips they do, which is slowing the freight and deliveries supply chain. The delivery of orders in October was much slower than before. Li Bing “The delivery of orders in October was much slower than before. My customers have complained to me a lot,” said Li Bing, operations manager at a Guangzhou-based online shopping platform. “The rising diesel price is pushing up our costs,” said a Wuhan-based regional manager of a major logistics company, who did not want to be named. “The cost of filling up a semi-trailer truck has increased by 200 yuan to 300 yuan recently, which means the cost per 100km has risen 20 yuan to 30 yuan for each truck.” China’s top economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), has attributed the tight supply of diesel to “the continuous increase in oil prices in the international market”, culminating with “peak consumption season in China”. Demand for oil shot up after most major economies began to recover from the pandemic this year. Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies have rejected calls from the United States to increase supply, which has also pushed up prices. Brent crude oil was traded at around US$83.6 per barrel on Monday, more than doubling in price from a year ago. China’s power crunch, caused by a coal shortage that has swept the nation since mid September, has also impacted supply and demand for diesel, according to a report last month by OilChem, an energy and chemical information provider in China. Power rationing has increased demand for diesel-generated electricity, while the high energy-consuming oil refining industry has had to restrict production. In a bid to increase supply and stabilise prices, the NDRC said on Sunday it had coordinated with the National Energy Administration and China’s two major oil companies, PetroChina and Sinopec, to increase supply of refined oil. Ling Yiqun, deputy general manager of Sinopec, was quoted in the NDRC notice as saying people’s livelihood and retail sales would be given priority and the company would make sure there was stable supply at its gas stations across the country. At present, the supply and demand of diesel in some areas is tight Ling Yiqun “At present, the supply and demand of diesel in some areas is tight. We think it is short-term, and the situation is expected to improve soon,” Ling said. Chinese authorities have also suspended diesel exports for November to alleviate the domestic shortage. The ban is likely to stay in place for the rest of the year, energy and commodities market intelligence provider JLC said in a note last week. The National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration said late last month it would release petrol and diesel reserves to boost supply and stabilise prices, but it did not disclose how much would be available to the market. China’s truck drivers still have a long road to post-coronavirus recovery Kang Wu, head of Asia analytics at S&P Global Platts, believes the move to release some state reserves is aimed at calming segments of the domestic market. “The agencies in charge of the release have only limited amounts of petroleum product reserves, as such the volume is likely to be small and symbolic, reflecting the government’s intention to ensure supply,” said Wu. Wu expects global oil supply to remain tight at present while S&P Global Platts estimates prices for the Dated Brent crude benchmark to ease in the first half of 2022. The tight supply has prompted China’s leaders to emphasise the importance of energy security in recent weeks. If fuel prices continue to rise, it will certainly affect the stability of logistics and transport Joe Li During a visit to a state-owned oilfield in Shandong province in October, President Xi Jinping said China must secure energy supply in “its own hands.” Still, small manufacturers are worried about whether their goods will be delivered to buyers on time. “If fuel prices continue to rise, it will certainly affect the stability of logistics and transport,” said Joe Li, a male underwear manufacturer in Guangzhou. “For example, if truck drivers go on strike, as they did two years ago, then it will definitely affect our deliveries during Singles’ Day shopping season.”",2021-11-08T17:16:17+08:00,2021-11-08T16:59:15+08:00,2021-11-08T17:40:04+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3155287/chinas-surging-diesel-prices-ripple-across-logistics-supply,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/11/08/3b7c3f1c-4055-11ec-b9bb-5bc84a21bb41_image_hires_174002.jpg?itok=votMNuAA&v=1636364413,China Economy
5 things you need to know about China’s power crisis,5 things you need to know about China’s power crisis,"['China has been dealing with power rationing and blackouts since September due to Beijing’s determination to cut emissions and surging prices', 'The power crunch has already had an impact on the economy and has raised concerns ahead of the winter heating season']",Andrew Mullen,"1. China’s state planner is weighing steps to tame prices China’s state planner has met coal producers and an industry body to discuss measures such as setting price levels and ways to better identify companies engaged in “profiteering”, it said on Thursday, aiming to tame prices during a severe power crunch. Coal futures have nearly halved from a record high on October 19 after the talks on price intervention at Wednesday’s meeting held by the powerful National Development and Reform Commission. The meeting “focused on the reasonable price range and profit margin that should be maintained to promote the coordinated and sustainable development of the coal industry and downstream power industries,” the planning body said. It did not disclose what level prices would be set at, but three major coal producers said on Wednesday they would fix ceilings for prices of thermal coal at 1,200 yuan (US$188) a tonne for the winter heating season.  2. It’s increasing China’s demand for natural gas China’s demand for natural gas for this winter is expected to rise by 10 per cent from a year earlier to 6.3 billion cubic feet, an official from the country’s top oil and gas producer, PetroChina, said on Thursday. PetroChina has secured 3.7 billion cubic feet of gas supplies for this winter, up 8.4 per cent from a year ago, the official told a seminar organised by China’s state-backed Chongqing Gas Exchange in Tianjin. 3. It’s causing supply issues for Samsung Samsung Electronics said on Thursday it expects component shortages to affect chip demand from some customers in the current quarter, after reporting its highest quarterly profit in three years. The warning comes as producers of goods from televisions to cars have faced a host of supply chain issues ranging from a shortage of logic chip parts, manpower shortages, logistics snarls, and delays at parts plants due to power cuts in China. “A longer-than-expected component supply issue may need to be monitored due to potential impacts” on the manufacturing of devices that use memory chips, Samsung said in a statement, although it added there was “strong fundamental demand for servers from increased investments from technology companies”. 4. China could build new coal plants overseas even after Xi’s pledge Chinese state-owned enterprises have a massive pipeline of coal-fired power projects in more than a dozen countries and it remains unclear if they will be scrapped, even after President Xi Jinping’s pledge to stop building plants abroad. New projects are in place to deliver almost 14 gigawatts (GW) of generating capacity, according to a report by Just Finance, a Denmark-based non-profit organisation that tracked building contracts and agreements. The state-run firms announced more than 3.6GW of projects this year alone, including around 1.3GW each in South Africa and Indonesia. Why is coal so important to China's economy? Some 10GW of projects had previously been finalised and have not yet begun construction, according to the study released on Wednesday. The pipeline spans countries across Southeast Asia, Africa and Europe. The report helps illustrate China’s importance to curbing further growth in the use of the fossil fuel, and the need for specifics on Xi’s commitment – made at the United Nations General Assembly in September – that the world’s second largest economy will end support for coal developments overseas. Xi did not clarify whether he was referring to both the financing and construction of new coal plants, and what would become of existing projects at various stages of progress. “There is a transparency problem for China’s overseas coal deals,” said Wawa Wang, programme director at Just Finance. “It makes the monitoring of critical information specific to project appraisal, project status and financial disclosure difficult.” 5. China’s wind giant sees demand boom resuming after 2021 blip For China’s biggest turbine makers, 2021 may turn out to be a year of pause from a torrid pace of wind projects, judging by the bullish outlooks from both the industry and analysts. The sector has faced a sharp slowdown after delivering a record amount of new capacity last year to beat a deadline for government subsidies. Key incentives for onshore wind ended at the end of 2020, while offshore allowances lapse this year. A weakening pace was clearly evident in the financial results of the country’s biggest turbine manufacturer, which late on Tuesday reported an 11 per cent drop in revenue for the third quarter. Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology sold 6.4GW of turbines for the first nine months of 2021, compared with last year’s 8.3GW. Yet the turbine business is expected to pick up as China and the rest of the world embrace renewable energy .

"China’s power crisis sends magnesium prices skyward, choking supply chain and leaving Europe desperate",How has China’s magnesium monopoly crippled global supply?,"['Global automotive industry depends on magnesium, but China has nearly a complete monopoly on the industry, producing 87 per cent of the world’s supply', 'Magnesium production is power-intensive and emits five times more carbon pollutants than steel production, meaning some smelting plants may be shut down for several months']",Jess Ma,"After years of stable prices, magnesium costs have skyrocketed while a shortage of the metal is choking downstream users in its supply chain, especially the global automotive industry. And it appears that China’s power crisis and subsequent crackdown on energy-intensive industries is largely to blame. China has almost a complete monopoly on the metal’s global production, and the smelting process is very power-intensive. A monthly review of the metal, by the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association (CNMA), revealed a sudden spike in the price of magnesium between August and September, when it doubled to a monthly average of nearly 42,000 yuan (US$6,600) a tonne – a 230 per cent year-on-year increase – and nudged as high as 70,000 yuan (US$11,000) a tonne during September. Magnesium’s price had been hovering between 14,000 and 20,000 yuan a tonne over the past decade. The shortage and soaring prices are of particular concern to the metal’s primary user – carmakers. China’s power crisis: why is it happening, and how bad is it? Last week, the German non-ferrous metal industrial association WVM wrote to the German government, warning about the impact of the shortage on all of Europe, as a result of China’s power cuts. It also noted that China accounts for 87 per cent of the global production of magnesium. “It is expected that the current magnesium inventories in Germany, and respectively in the whole of Europe, will be exhausted by the end of November 2021,” the letter said, according to Reuters. The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (EAMA) also submitted an open letter to the EU Commission last week flagging the “catastrophic impact” of production shortages, business closures and associated job losses if Europe runs out of magnesium stocks by the end of November, according to a note by Argus Media, an independent provider of energy and commodity price benchmarks. “Our industries jointly call on the EU Commission and national governments to urgently work towards immediate actions with their Chinese counterparties to mitigate the short-term critical shortage issue, as well as the longer-term supply effects on European industries,” the EAMA’s letter said. Now, with the magnesium supply also tight, carmakers are facing higher production costs and further potential output curbs Mok Yuen Cheng, S&P Global Platts China began suffering from rolling blackouts in September as a result of an electricity shortage. In response, local authorities ordered the country’s biggest magnesium smelters in Yulin, Shaanxi province, to cut power usage. Magnesium production at Yulin’s roughly 50 smelters in Fugu county – which account for about 60 per cent of China’s total output – was halved from mid-September, and 15 of those smelters are likely to see a complete halt in production until March, according to industry figures and media reports. The CNMA said magnesium prices quoted by producers in the Shanxi region from late September to early October were 52,600-52,700 yuan a tonne, while those in Ningxia were 52,400-52,500 yuan a tonne, and in Shaanxi the prices were 52,400 to 52,500 yuan a tonne. “The magnesium shortage will likely hit the auto and aluminium sectors the hardest,” said Mok Yuen Cheng, senior managing editor for non-ferrous metals at commodities analyst S&P Global Platts. “Europe, Japan and China have already seen auto output cuts this year due to [semiconductor] chip shortages . “Now, with the magnesium supply also tight, carmakers are facing higher production costs and further potential output curbs.” Mok said the impact of the power cuts is telling. In September, new European car registrations fell 23 per cent, China’s automotive output dropped 17.9 per cent, and Toyota Motor cut its total output by 40 per cent. Magnesium is used to strengthen aluminium alloys – a key raw material in auto production. An estimated 15kg of magnesium is used in every car produced, Mok said. Mounting pressure to curb carbon emissions , along with the high cost of power generation due to expensive thermal coal , have contributed to China’s power woes and triggered strict power-rationing measures, particularly for commercial and industrial users. Magnesium production is especially vulnerable to the power crisis because, in addition to being so power-intensive, it also emits five times the carbon pollutants compared with steel production, according to research by Shanghai Jiao Tong University. China outlines strategy on economic challenges, from power crisis to Evergrande And for those automotive producers outside China that are able to secure supplies, they have been facing higher export prices. Export prices in September were twice as much as the average export price between January and August, according to the CNMA. The free-on-board price – referring to the risk-factored price borne by the buyer – rose to US$6,573.57 a tonne in September, from US$3,258.06 a tonne at the start of the year.   Megawatt hours to produce 1 tonne Steel 4-6 Magnesium 35-40 Aluminium 16-17 At the end of September, some manufacturers and traders were quoting prices of between US$8,240 and US$8,250 a tonne. North America is also suffering from a magnesium shortage but, unlike Europe, has a large domestic producer, US Magnesium, which has offered a degree of protection, said Stephen Williamson, research manager at commodities analyst CRU Group. However, Lin Ruhai, president of the CNMA’s magnesium branch, told delegates at the association’s 24th annual conference in Yulin last week that the crisis was not expected to last, as consumers would seek out magnesium substitutes, thereby cooling demand and price of the metal next year, according to a note by Argus Media.",2021-10-28T13:00:17+08:00,2021-10-27T20:08:58+08:00,2021-11-02T15:22:24+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3153909/chinas-power-crisis-sends-magnesium-prices-skyward-choking,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/11/02/debc03d0-3716-11ec-bf9d-b73b258185bb_image_hires_152222.jpg?itok=HOtZ09gk&v=1635837753,China Economy
"Rising coal, natural gas prices to fuel inflation across the globe and hasten transition to renewable...","Rising energy prices to fuel inflation, hasten shift to renewables: CME","['Inflation in the US, which has been above 5 per cent for four straight months, could soon become a global phenomenon, CME economist Erik Norland says', 'Surging energy costs will have a cascading effect on electricity prices and consequently manufacturing costs in Asia']",Yujie Xue,"CME Group , the world’s largest futures exchange operator, said rising coal and natural gas prices are expected to have a profound impact on consumers, as higher energy bills and manufacturing costs push inflation rates higher globally. The elevated prices of coal and gas will also hasten the shift towards renewable energy . Supply chain bottlenecks and rising energy costs have kept the US headline inflation rate at more than 5 per cent for four straight months, but it could soon be a global phenomenon, according to Erik Norland, executive director and senior economist at CME Group. “The risk over the next few months is that the inflation that we’ve seen rising in the United States might begin to rise in other countries,” said Norland during a media briefing on Tuesday. “We’ve seen a tremendous rise in the price of coal, and we’ve also seen a tremendous rise in the price of natural gas, so the risk is that it begins to push electricity prices a great deal higher around Asia, [where] it could also really impact manufacturing.” Thermal coal futures traded on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange rose 8 per cent to 1,692 yuan (US$264.7) a tonne last Friday, the biggest weekly rise on record since they began trading in 2013 and have nearly tripled in price since the beginning of this year. Prices of imported liquefied natural gas have also almost doubled year to date. On average, natural gas accounted for about 3 per cent of the cost of a manufactured good before prices went up, according to Norland. With gas prices tripling, that cost could expand to around 12 per cent, and drive up the cost of electricity to 14 per cent of the production cost of manufactured goods, from 7 per cent previously. China and India rely heavily on coal, which accounted for about 60 per cent and 70 per cent, respectively, of their electricity generation in 2020. If electricity prices double or triple, that could easily add 7 to 14 per cent to the cost of manufactured goods in Asia, CME estimated. “It [higher coal, natural gas and oil prices] is going to put a lot of upward pressure on the aspect of consumer price inflation, both directly from consumers’ energy bills, and indirectly through higher costs for manufactured goods and even agricultural products,” said Norland. The recent shortage of coal in China has led to industrial and residential power rationing in more than 20 provinces since September. Several factors have led to the coal shortages, according to analysts, including a surge in power demand after the Covid-19 pandemic, low stocks and supply disruption due to extreme weather in the country’s largest coal mining province Shanxi. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China’s top economic planner, said on Tuesday it was looking to intervene and bring record high coal prices back down to a “reasonable range”. This caused China’s coal futures to fall 8 per cent to their downward limit in night trading after the announcement, the steepest plunge since August. Norland expected the coal shortage-driven inflation to last for six months or a year at most, and expected coal inventories to eventually recover and prices to moderate. “I don’t think this is a problem that’s gonna last forever, but it will probably incentivise the energy transition,” he said. “I think a lot of countries are looking at this and saying that we have to diversify into more wind power and solar power. The good news there is that solar power and wind power costs continue to come down every single year.”",2021-10-21T07:30:25+08:00,2021-10-20T18:35:29+08:00,2021-10-21T07:50:15+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/commodities/article/3153041/rising-coal-natural-gas-prices-fuel-inflation-across-globe-and,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/10/21/643d03de-3176-11ec-8bc1-f82f86ab0ffa_image_hires_075011.jpg?itok=Yt2GelsE&v=1634773822,Commodities

Twelve-month thermal coal futures for January 2022 delivery, the most actively transacted contracts for the fuel, slumped by their 8 per cent daily limit on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange to 1,755.4 yuan each. The shares of at least seven coal miners, including the state-owned China Coal Energy and Yanzhou Coal Mining, plunged by their 10 per cent daily limits on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. The mood has soured suddenly on coal, after a meeting convened by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) with major coal producers and the industry guild to find ways to restore fuel prices back to “a reasonable range” ahead of expected peak demand in the northern hemisphere winter. “The current run-up of coal prices has completely diverged from the fundamentals of supply and demand,” the NDRC said on its website . “The commission will use every necessary means allowed by law to return the coal market back to rationality and ensure safe and stable supply of energy and heating in winter.” The statement by the NDRC, responsible for every aspect of China’s economic policy from setting prices to approving investments, is by far the toughest by the government, after surging coal prices led to power cuts, brownouts and shortages in at least 20 provinces. The power crisis has weighed on a manufacturing-led economy that is still trying to outgrow the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, causing the third-quarter economy to grow at its slowest quarterly pace since September 2020 . Residents in north-eastern China, which typically experience the harshest winters, had already begun experiencing power cuts in September, as power plants reduced their generation due to surging costs of thermal coal. Coal futures had soared 172 per cent through Tuesday this year on the Zhengzhou exchange, and the surge accelerated over the past month as the government’s efforts to cut carbon emission tightened supply, while rising prices in crude oil and natural gas fuelled the buying frenzy. The government will crack down on false information disclosure, moves to collude on and inflate prices and hoarding, the NDRC said in the statement. The planning body also called for a meeting with officials from the Zhengzhou exchange on Tuesday, asking the bourse to monitor abnormal trading activities and expose speculative trading, the Securities Times reported. Yanzhou Coal was the biggest decliner among Chinese coal miners, dropping 10.9 per cent to HK$13.56 in Hong Kong. Pingdingshan Tianan Coal Mining, the dominant miner in Henan province, fell by the 10 per cent daily limit on the Shanghai Stock Exchange to 10.85 yuan.

How China’s coal crisis exposes the hypocrisy of the West’s carbon footprint,China’s coal crisis exposes the hypocrisy of the West’s carbon footprint,,Andy Xie,"A coal shortage is threatening the global economic recovery. Blackouts could spread from China and India to all the emerging economies still mostly reliant on coal. As supply can’t be ramped up in the near term, the shortages could worsen as energy demand rises with winter’s arrival. That may trigger another emerging-market crisis. The coal price has more than tripled in a year to near historical highs, while oil prices are halfway to their peak. The near-term trend is still up. As blackouts trigger a political backlash at home and domestic supply remains difficult to ramp up quickly, China is likely to bid for more coal in the international market, possibly increasing imports by 15 million tonnes per month, or over 50 per cent more than last year. As the global supply can’t respond so quickly, the price has the potential to skyrocket again. How high it goes depends on how much China is willing to pay. During the previous coal shortage in 2008, China was paying close to US$200 per tonne. As China is much richer now, the price could go much higher. China’s coal-fired electricity production rose by 12.6 per cent in the first eight months, while coal production was up only 4.4 per cent. The big gap needs to be met by either running down inventory or increasing imports. China consumed 3.8 billion tonnes of coal or 52 per cent of the global total in 2020, according to the International Energy Agency, of which 2.3 billion tonnes was for electricity production. The gap between electricity demand and coal production works out to a shortfall of 189 million tonnes. China imported about 300 million tonnes of coal last year. An additional demand of such magnitude in a global trade of just 1.4 billion tonnes would trigger an enormous price response. The surging price so far has deterred China from fully filling the gap with imports. Running down inventory has played a substantial part. As inventory dwindles, rolling blackouts have become an option. The surging electricity demand is driven by export recovery. China is on pace to increase exports by US$700 billion this year, more than Japan’s total exports. As central banks and governments hand out money to people during the pandemic, they are having a good time by ordering goods made in China. Adding one Japan’s worth of exports in a year obviously requires a huge increase in energy consumption. As China depends on coal for roughly 70 per cent of its energy use, this global demand recovery is shifting energy use to coal – the dirtiest fossil fuel. It must be hard for the lawyers who run the major central banks to fully appreciate how their actions are affecting the world’s climate. The tremendous growth in China’s exports is happening against the backdrop of the three-year trade war that the United States has waged on China and a growing bad vibe towards made-in-China goods. Yet the global economy is becoming ever more dependent on China as the factory of the world. It exposes the disconnect between perception and reality. My two cents’ worth is that people want goods, but they don’t want to make them. Central banks and governments are giving them free money. All they need to do is press a few buttons on the mobile phone. The orders go to the lowest-cost producer – China. And consumers like the low prices and don’t really want to know where the stuff is made. The world has been waging war on coal. The West, in particular, has been shifting away from coal in recent years. Last year, global coal demand fell by 5 per cent due to politics and Covid-19. As the global economy emerges from the pandemic, coal demand has shifted more to the emerging economies that are coal-dependent. The climate warriors in the West have pushed coal out of their homes, only for it to re-emerge elsewhere. The war on coal is far from won. The sky-high price would predictably lead to widespread capacity expansion in emerging economies. When this supply is ready, the global economic cycle may already be on a downward path. Just as the price is overshooting now, so it would undershoot in such a scenario. This is the age-old story of commodity boom-and-bust cycles. Climate change activists in the West are putting pressure on fossil fuel production there, especially on coal. “Outsourcing” to China has been an easy way out. These countries can report good numbers in fighting climate change . But the global total does not reflect a proportionate cut. Emerging economies need cheap and plentiful supplies of energy to grow. Coal fits the bill perfectly. The world needs to find alternative energy sources that are not just green, but also cheap. Meantime, the only solution is for rich countries to cut their consumption sharply. Climate enthusiasts in the West can save the planet by putting on an extra jumper this winter, maybe even wearing a coat indoors. It’s time to dress up or shut up.

"CATL’s EV battery breakthrough holds promise as cost-effective, game-changing alternative the industry’s...",The Chinese battery maker at the forefront of revolutionising EVs,"['CATL makes rapid progress on sodium-ion batteries, improving the performance of the alternative technology to the mainstay lithium-ion batteries', 'The commercialisation of sodium-ion batteries is still some time away, as it will take time to fine-tune products that are a viable option to lithium-ion, say analysts']",Eric Ng,"The first of a three-part series on battery packs looks at the world’s largest producer CATL and how it occupies the apex of a technological revolution to assemble cheaper and more durable cells to power electric cars. Ningde in southeastern China’s Fujian province, known primarily for its tea plantations, seldom rolls off the tongue in automotive circles or the technology industry. But on a rainy Friday in late May, the city of fewer than 3 million people was the epicentre of a major technological breakthrough, one that could shake up the world’s supply of battery packs, giving China the technological and competitive edge in providing cheap and durable power source for driving electric vehicles. Robin Zeng Yuqun , the founder and chairman of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), revealed that the world’s largest producer of EV battery packs – with customers from BMW to Tesla – was making progress with sodium-ion batteries. Two months later, CATL unveiled its first generation of sodium-ion batteries, and came up with a solution to mix its mainstay lithium-ion packs with the alternative technology into new packs to optimise performance. “Some people [said] it would be hard to make breakthroughs in the chemistry of batteries, and that improvements can only be made in their physical structures,” Zeng told 170 of CATL’s biggest shareholders, including China Merchants Bank and Hillhouse Capital, during the company’s annual general meeting. “By using a high-throughput calculation platform and simulation technology … [we] continuously evolved and enabled sodium-ion batteries to enter the fast track to industrialisation.” Zeng’s announcement was music to the ears of not only CATL investors, whose value has topped 1.2 trillion yuan (US$189 billion) with a 41 per cent jump in its stock price this year, but also makers of EVs, or new-energy vehicles (NEVs) as they are called in China. Most NEV batteries – from the ones assembled by CATL to packs produced by Panasonic and Samsung – rely on lithium and cobalt as the key raw material, both of which are concentrated in a small number of nations. The world’s reserves of lithium stood at 21 million tonnes in 2020, of which 44 per cent was in Chile, 22 per cent in Australia, 9 per cent in Argentina and 7 per cent in China, according to the US Geological Survey. Australia, meanwhile, accounted for nearly half of the production, while China – the world’s largest NEV market – imported some 80 per cent of the industry’s needs. Amid surging demand for battery packs, led by the popularity and surging production of EVs, the world’s supply of lithium is heading for a “serious supply deficit” by 2027, which could hamper the production of an estimated 3.3 million NEVs that year, according to a forecast by the energy research firm Rystad Energy. Cobalt ’s global reserves stand at 7.1 million tonnes, half of which was in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which also accounted for 68 per cent of worldwide output. By contrast, sodium is readily found and is virtually inexhaustible. Global EV sales reached 3.1 million units last year, an increase of 30 per cent from 2019, according to Fitch Ratings. They are expected to make up 45 per cent of the global car market by 2040 compared to 4 per cent last year, the rating agency predicted. As EVs gain popularity alongside a drive to replace fossil fuel with renewable energy in generating grid-delivered electricity amid a global decarbonisation campaign to fight climate change , demand for battery metals will keep rising. The commodities market has already priced in lithium’s expected tightening of supply. The prices of battery-grade lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate have both more than tripled in the past year to over 160,000 yuan (US$24,850) a tonne. Facing looming shortages, global carmakers and battery producers have been seeking alternatives to the dominant lithium-ion batteries. Besides sodium-ion, another emerging technology is solid-state batteries , which use solid electrolytes unlike liquid lithium-ion batteries. While both offer greater safety than lithium-ion batteries, which are susceptible to catching fire at high temperatures, costs remain a barrier to the commercialisation of solid-state batteries, with experts saying mass production is a few years away. Sodium-ion batteries also have the added advantage of fast charging and higher performance under low temperatures compared to lithium-ion ones. CATL claimed its first-generation sodium battery can be recharged to 80 per cent of capacity in 15 minutes at room temperature. At minus 20 degrees Celsius, it loses less than 10 per cent of the energy after it is fully charged, according to the company. The next-generation product’s energy storage density is expected to exceed 200 Watt-hours per kg, up from 160Wh of the first-generation prototype, Zeng said. Watt-hours are used as a measure of power output. This range is comparable to those achieved by lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, one of two main types of lithium-ion batteries. NCM, the other product that uses nickel, manganese and cobalt in different ratios, has a higher capacity ranging from 240Wh to 350Wh per kg. Tesla cars, which use LFP and NCA (nickel cobalt aluminium) batteries, can be charged in 15 minutes at certain fast-charging stations giving them a 200-mile (320km) range, but normal charging gives only 44 miles of range per hour charged. CATL said it plans to have a “ basic industrial chain ” set up by 2023, and is inviting suppliers, customers and research institutions to “jointly accelerate the promotion and development” of sodium batteries. Although it has not given any cost estimate, CATL said in August that it planned to raise 58.2 billion yuan through a private share placement to finance the construction of new battery plants. The company, however, is likely to benefit from some government support, although details are lacking. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said in late August that it will provide policy support to help quicken their commercialisation, as part of overall efforts to help the nation achieve its twin goal of peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and net zero emissions by 2060. Sodium-ion is also one of the novel battery technologies earmarked for support by the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economic planning agency. Faster development of energy storage is part of the nation’s strategy to both enhance energy security and achieve decarbonisation. Still, analysts said it will take years to commercialise sodium-ion batteries, while potential customers wait for more progress and details. “Large scale adoption of sodium-ion batteries commercially is highly unlikely within the next two to three years,” said Dennis Ip, head of utilities and renewables research at Daiwa Capital Markets. “We see the development of sodium-ion batteries as more of a hedge against potential lithium shortages or cost hikes.” To be sure, even if sodium-ion technology promises cheaper batteries in the future, their performance and mass market launch timing, remain unknown. Their lower energy-storage capacity could also require other battery components to achieve the same power performance, adding to the costs. “We are still unclear when this technology can bring tangible impact on costs, efficiency, energy density and safety,” said Brian Gu, vice-chairman of Guangzhou-based EV maker Xpeng Motors . “We, as a downstream adopter of battery technology, are closely monitoring its development … it is still early days.” While these factors will be mitigated eventually by cost savings as production scale is ramped up, analysts have cast doubts on the suitability of sodium-ion batteries for EVs. “Their low energy density – even when combined with some lithium-ion battery cells – raises concerns over driving range and hence appropriateness for certain markets,” said David Merriman, manager of battery and EV materials at Roskill. Does China lead the electric car battery industry? One thing going for sodium-ion batteries is that will definitely be less sensitive to the rising metal costs – a major concern for lithium battery makers – because of sodium’s widespread availability. If the price of each of the key battery materials rises by 10 per cent, the material costs of sodium-ion batteries only increase by 0.8 per cent, much lower than the 3.2 per cent for LFP batteries and 4.6 per cent for NCM batteries, analysts Le Xu and Max Reid at Roskill’s parent Wood Mackenzie, wrote in a blog last month. They see sodium-ion batteries as a niche product, chipping away at some of LFP batteries’ share in the EV and energy-storage systems markets and reaching 20 gigawatt-hour in sales by 2030. Founder Securities’ analysts have a rosier outlook, predicting 33GWh of sodium-ion batteries to be deployed in minicars and 205GWh in energy-storage systems by 2025. Those predictions are in sharp contrast to the burgeoning global lithium-ion battery production capacity, which may double to 1,447GWh by 2025 from 706GWh this year, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. CATL originally started out as a licensed manufacturer in 2011, before developing its own technology. Riding on the global NEV boom, CATL quickly expanded production from Fujian to four other Chinese provinces – Qinghai, Sichuan, Guangdong and Jiangsu. It started production at its first overseas plant in Germany this year, and five years earlier opened a research centre in Munich. CATL is not the only company exploring sodium-ion technology in China. In 2017, HiNa Battery Technology, a spin-off of the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Physics, became the first Chinese firm to look into the technology. Jiangsu-based HiNa demonstrated its maiden product in a low-speed mini electric car in 2018. It aims to develop a more competitive alternative to the pollution-causing lead-acid battery used in 90 per cent of such vehicles used mostly in rural areas. The battery’s energy density reached 145Wh per kg, over five times that of lead-acid batteries. Sheffield, Britain-based Faradion – set up a decade ago – was the world’s first company dedicated to sodium-ion batteries development, according to a Founder Securities report. It is demonstrating the use of sodium-ion batteries in low-cost transport such as electric bikes and scooters. A year ago, California-based start-up Natron Energy launched a pizza-box sized battery pack for use in data centres and telecoms firms, but they are yet to commercialise a product for EVs. It will take several years for sodium-ion batteries to be designed, tested and approved by end users into commercial-scale products, Roskill’s Merriman noted. “Whether sodium-ion technologies will be viable alternatives in an increasingly competitive electric vehicles market, displacing lithium-ion and potentially solid-state technologies [in] mass-produced vehicles is unclear,” he said. “Li-ion [will] remain the dominant technology in EVs through to the end of the decade.” Additional reporting by Daniel Ren in Shanghai",2021-10-16T11:00:23+08:00,2021-10-15T12:35:12+08:00,2021-10-23T16:00:25+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3152434/catls-ev-battery-breakthrough-holds-promise-cost-effective-game,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/10/15/24c0c2d6-2cc6-11ec-9021-f4cecde6cb15_image_hires_200402.jpg?itok=gqbokWCM&v=1634299454,Companies
China’s power crisis prompts Beijing to liberalise electricity pricing,"Gripped by an energy crisis, China liberalises power pricing","['China says electricity generated from coal will be fully liberalised and industrial and commercial users will buy power at market prices', 'The electricity pricing reforms are Beijing’s latest attempt to tackle recent electricity shortages that have crippled industrial output']",Amanda Lee,"China’s top economic planning agency said on Tuesday it would liberalise pricing in the state-controlled power market to help resolve an electricity crisis that has caused rationing across more than half the country and threatens to weigh on economic growth. Under the reform, industrial and commercial users will buy electricity at market prices and a direct power purchasing scheme that keeps costs artificially low for big users will be abolished, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said. In addition, the state planner said all electricity produced by coal-fired power will be sold via the market, up from 70 per cent. It gave no indication when either of the changes would take effect. The reforms are Beijing’s latest attempt to tackle widespread power shortages that have crippled industrial output and sparked debate about the effectiveness of the nation’s centrally-controlled electricity sector. This is a very important reform for China’s power system Lin Boqiang Energy experts hailed the measures as significant changes that will bring more transparency to electricity pricing and alleviate operating difficulties for coal-fired power companies. “This is a very important reform for China’s power system. Although [China’s power pricing] is not fully market-oriented, this is a very big step toward complete marketisation,” said Lin Boqiang, dean of the China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy at Xiamen University. Although the NDRC is not expecting energy inflation as a result of the reforms, it said local governments should consider subsidies to small to medium-sized enterprises. There would be limited impact on consumer prices, it added. “The cost of electricity for upstream users and industrial production … may be driven up, but the reforms will help [better reflect] supply and demand in the electricity market, better protect consumers, ensuring stable production at enterprises,” NDRC official Peng Shaozong said at a press conference. Abolishing the direct power purchasing scheme is a major change to China’s electricity pricing mechanism. The programme allows local governments to force power generators into selling electricity to commercial users at prices cheaper than the fixed on-grid and retail prices set by the central government. The lower prices make power companies unprofitable amid rising costs for raw materials like thermal coal , therefore discouraging them from producing more electricity. The NDRC reform plans come after Premier Li Keqiang announced at a State Council meeting last week electricity prices will be allowed to rise by as much as 20 per cent against government benchmarks, compared with the current cap of 10 per cent. High coal prices have hit the country’s power generators hard, triggering energy rationing in at least 20 out of China’s 31 provincial-level jurisdictions. China’s power production increased by 11 per cent year on year for the period between January and August, but its coal production grew by only 4 per cent over the same time, according to research by Macquarie Capital. The NDRC said it hoped the higher costs for energy-intensive industries would push them to reduce “unreasonable energy consumption” and consider investments in efficiency. China’s pledge to become carbon neutral by 2060 has added new impetus to long-standing efforts to curb energy use and intensity. Provincial governments are racing to reduce energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product by 3 per cent this year. Li Chengren, director of finance and audits at the State Grid Energy Research Institute, said floating the electricity price as much as 20 per cent would be enough to cover power companies’ surging coal costs. The main message is that power price shall fluctuate, this fundamentally shifts the mindset of generators and consumers Qin Yan, Refinitiv He added that by banishing the direct power purchasing scheme, electricity prices would be more transparent and give generators more clarity about production costs. “It is helpful to further alleviate the operating difficulties of coal-fired power companies, ensure the sustainable and healthy development of power generation companies, and the safe and stable supply of power during the peak winter period this year,” he wrote on Tuesday in China Energy News , a publication under the state-owned People’s Daily . Qin Yan, lead carbon analyst at financial data provider Refinitiv, said it could take some time before caps on electricity prices can be completely removed. “The 20 per cent range is really just a start, since this is tiny compared to the 300 per cent rise in coal prices this year,” she said. “The main message is that the power price shall fluctuate. This fundamentally shifts the mindset of generators and consumers.”",2021-10-12T19:30:10+08:00,2021-10-12T18:37:02+08:00,2021-10-25T15:05:46+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3152095/chinas-power-crisis-prompts-beijing-liberalise-electricity,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/10/25/bb84d122-2b30-11ec-9021-f4cecde6cb15_image_hires_150544.jpg?itok=v__9wcgP&v=1635145554,China Economy
"China’s bid to ‘weaponise trade’ crumbles as it turns to Australia for cotton, copper despite import ban",China’s bid to ‘weaponise trade’ crumbles as it turns to Australia despite ban,"['China has imported copper and cotton from Australia this year, despite imposing informal bans on the goods due to diplomatic tensions', 'Global supply shortages and political conflict forced China to turn to Australian imports, but there are few signs the trend will continue']",Su-Lin Tan,"China has imported US$30 million worth of Australian copper concentrate and increased purchases of cotton from the country amid international sanctions over Xinjiang , despite unofficially banning the products in November last year, Chinese trade data shows. Chinese importers also snapped up the lion’s share of Australia’s bumper wheat harvest for the 2021-22 season, making it the country’s largest buyer just as global supplies fall. Global shortages and political tensions have forced China to turn to Australian products, especially as its economy has bounced back from the coronavirus pandemic, although there are few signs the trend will be permanent. Despite taking punitive trade action against Australia over several issues, including Canberra’s push for an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus, China will avoid shooting itself in the foot economically, said Stephen Olson, a former trade negotiator with the United States Trade Representative. Any punitive actions will be carefully calculated to maximise pain on Australia and minimise disruptions in China Stephen Olson China will demonstrate pragmatism when it comes to balancing its economic prospects with its political interests, he said. “Any punitive actions will be carefully calculated to maximise pain on Australia and minimise disruptions in China,” said Olson, who is also a senior research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation. “Given the high levels of trade and investment between China and Australia, this will not always be easy to do. “And the exact composition of the package of punitive actions will occasionally need to be reassessed and potentially adjusted to reflect evolving commercial and economic realities.” In June, official trade data shows that China bought 11,000 tonnes of copper concentrate from Australia for the first time since November, when Beijing unofficially banned traders from importing a number of Australian goods as tensions escalated between the two countries. China-Australia relations: damage from trade bans limited as Australian exporters ‘successfully pivot’ to new markets As China’s post-pandemic economic recovery ramped up, it stepped up copper imports, particularly from key exporters in South America, but did not buy from Australia until supplies in Chile and Peru were hit by market changes and political risks, respectively, in the middle of the year. “Interestingly, this year China bought its first copper concentrate cargo from Australia in June after a gap of six months … [although] it might be too early to anticipate Australian copper concentrate shipments to resume into China as again there were no copper concentrate shipments arriving in July 2021,” said Pranay Shukla, associate director at market intelligence firm IHS Markit, while pointing out the 11-tonne cargo load was much lower than China’s pre-ban monthly imports from Australia. It is likely China’s purchase of copper ore and concentrate will slacken given the nation’s foreshadowed economic slowdown, indicating purchases from Australia may not be repeated, Shukla said. There was also a spike in cotton imports from Australia in April, which experts and analysts attributed not just to global supply constraints, but potentially US and European Union sanctions on Xinjiang cotton. Following the ban on Australian cotton , imports fell from about 14,000 tonnes in November last year to near zero until April, when China bought about 10,000 tonnes of cotton. China’s imports have fallen since April, but remained higher than the post-ban period of November 2020 and April, hovering between 2000-3000 tonnes a month. Before the conflict escalated, China had bought anywhere up to 80,000 tonnes of cotton from Australia per month. In April, a global cotton supply crunch had set in amid higher global demand for apparel and tighter cotton supplies from major exporters, the US and Brazil. “Strong demand together with supply concerns is expected to have prompted purchases from Australia in an attempt to secure supply while available and keep cotton manufacturers operating, and also potentially secure stocks ahead of anticipated price rises on the back of the supply concerns,” RaboResearch senior commodities analyst Cheryl Kalisch Gordon said. Crucially, the purchase coincided with US and the European bans on cotton products from Xinjiang , which led to many Chinese apparel and textile manufacturers buying up foreign cotton to accommodate some of the largest apparel retailers they serve, said Miran Ali, a spokesman for textile producer association Sustainable Textile of the East Asian Region. “They cannot use Xinjiang cotton for the US market or for any European brand that also sells in the US,” Ali said. “Therefore not only can they not use this for [say] Walmart, they can’t for [British apparel giant] Marks & Spencer’s either.” China, like the US, often weaponises trade in order to achieve political objectives. Sometimes it works, but sometimes it does not Tianlei Huang Not only does this show China’s pragmatism towards trade, but that countries which have weaponised trade cannot always “win”, said Tianlei Huang, research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “China, like the US, often weaponises trade in order to achieve political objectives. Sometimes it works, but sometimes it does not. In the Australia case, it seems China’s sanctions have yet to yield any real satisfactory results,” he said. “Will China learn its lessons? Probably not. China’s behaviour mirrors that of the US. As China continues to grow and trade with the rest of the world, Beijing will most likely keep trade sanctions as a geoeconomic instrument in its foreign policy toolbox, despite potential economic costs inflicted to itself.” Trade wars are costly to fight and the US-China trade war is a good example of a “lose-lose” situation for both nations, he added. Earlier this week, the US Trade Representative Katherine Tai started the process of exempting some Chinese goods from Trump-era tariffs, saying the phase-one trade deal did not meaningfully address the fundamental concerns Washington had with China’s trade practices and their harmful impacts on the US economy. Despite its damage, trade wars will remain a feature of geopolitical playbooks especially if countries cannot get issues resolved through official resolution mechanisms, Olson said. “When there are highly damaging predatory practices which have defied resolution through other channels and threaten even worse long-term consequences, policymakers sometime conclude that a trade war is the lesser evil,” he said. “Today, we are seeing an increase in punitive trade actions taken for geopolitical rather than economic reasons.”",2021-10-08T04:30:17+08:00,2021-10-07T19:38:40+08:00,2021-10-08T11:55:21+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3151549/chinas-bid-weaponise-trade-crumbles-it-turns-australia-cotton,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/10/08/e7340976-2759-11ec-8f06-8f17bcf6e46a_image_hires_115520.jpg?itok=9IccaNOa&v=1633665330,China Economy
"China’s CATL, Ganfeng ﻿lock in supplies of lithium as price of key battery metal touches record high",Soaring lithium prices spark flurry of deals for key battery metal,"['Lithium carbonate prices in China are at record highs after a nearly fivefold increase in the past year', 'CATL outbid Ganfeng Lithium for Canada’s Millennial Lithium, while its Chinese rival bought Mexico’s Bacanora Lithium in August']",Bloomberg,"Lithium is having a moment – and record prices will not deter the flurry of deals for the key battery metal. A number of acquisitions of lithium miners have been announced in recent months, including a proposed takeover of Millennial Lithium by the world’s largest battery maker. Industry consultants, investment bankers and analysts see this as just a taste of things to come, even with skyrocketing prices for the silvery white metal that is a key ingredient to power electric vehicles . Lithium carbonate prices in China are at record highs after a nearly fivefold increase in the past year, BloombergNEF analysts said on Wednesday in a note. The price of Chinese lithium shipped abroad has also climbed because of tight supply and stable battery demand, though at a slower pace than the domestic surge due to the absence of a spot market, according to the analysts. The rally comes as a global push for less polluting energy sources that has carmakers and battery manufacturers racing to secure supplies of so-called future-facing commodities including lithium, copper and nickel. Two Chinese companies sparked a bidding war for Canada’s Millennial, which has lithium assets in Argentina, with Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) eventually outbidding Ganfeng Lithium. That bidding war “is just a taste of what’s to come”, said Chris Berry of House Mountain Partners, a Washington-based industry consultancy. “I do see more mergers and acquisitions even at existing pricing.” The type of capital entering the electric-vehicle supply chain is more patient than in past cycles, Berry said. “It’s not just hedge funds riding momentum,” he said. “These are larger strategic players from both inside and outside the EV supply chain positioning amidst the decarbonisation thesis.” Chinese firms have been keen on securing strategic materials in South America in particular as they seek dominance in the EV supply chain. Ganfeng has been on an acquisition spree as the lithium market tightens. The company, which has stakes in mining operations in countries including Argentina, Australia and China, gobbled up Mexico’s Bacanora Lithium in August. CATL already had stakes in Neo Lithium, whose project is in Argentina. “We have and will continue to see the Chinese looking to buy lithium,” said Matthew Hind, head of global mining at Bank of Nova Scotia’s investment banking division. “There will also be small-cap consolidation as well as EV companies buying stakes in mines with strategic partners in order to secure supply.” “In other words, consolidation will be driven by several different players,” Hind said.",2021-10-07T12:22:42+08:00,2021-10-07T12:19:29+08:00,2021-10-07T12:22:33+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3151465/chinas-catl-ganfeng-lock-supplies-lithium-price-key-battery,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/10/07/ee136d80-2723-11ec-8f06-8f17bcf6e46a_image_hires_122231.jpg?itok=XY1jb9eC&v=1633580560,Companies
"China steps up coal imports from Kazakhstan, South Africa and Mozambique amid supply crunch","China boosts coal imports from Kazakhstan, Africa amid global supply crunch","['China has increased purchases of coal from Kazakhstan since the start of the year as power cuts have become more frequent and coal supplies dwindle', 'A global coal supply shortage has sent prices soaring and contributed to an electricity crunch that has hammered businesses in the world’s No 2 economy']",Su-Lin Tan,"China has been busy cultivating at least two new coal markets, Mozambique and South Africa, and expanding trade with smaller exporters, including Kazakhstan, Myanmar and Colombia, since the start of the year, as domestic demand for coal-fired power rises acutely amid an electricity crunch and continued ban on the commodity from Australia. On Monday, Zhejiang said it bought its first shipment of thermal coal from Kazakhstan, as the industrial province looks for new sources of supply, local media reported. Zhejiang Energy Group, which is backed by the provincial government, received a 136,000-tonne shipment of 6,000-calorie premium-quality coal at Liuheng Port. Though it was Zhejiang’s first batch of coal from Kazakhstan, China as a whole has been buying more thermal and coking coal from Kazakhstan since the start of the year, as power cuts have become more frequent and coal supplies dwindle. What has caused China’s electricity shortages, and is Beijing’s carbon-neutral goal solely to blame? China’s power shortage reached crisis point last month , with both households and the industrial sector asked to cut usage. “China has been importing from Kazakhstan more actively this past couple of years, primarily for coking coal but they’ve started buying high energy for thermal use this year too,” said Shirley Zhang, an analyst with energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “So, this is not a surprise at all, given the current supply crunch, or rather, the fear of supply crunch.” China started buying tiny volumes of coal from Kazakhstan in 2013, with purchases only starting to rise significantly in 2019, Chinese customs data shows. In February, China imported nearly 200,000 tonnes of coal, mostly “other bituminous coal”, which can be used for energy production. It also imported bituminous coking coal, which is used in steel making. It bought another 165,000 tonnes of mostly “other bituminous coal” in June. China has also exhibited similar coal-buying patterns with Myanmar and Colombia. China started its low-volume trade with Myanmar in 2019, before it declined to nearly zero from the middle of last year and then started ramping up in March, according to customs data. Historically, Colombia has been only a fallback option for China’s coal needs, but in June monthly imports of Colombian coal reached one of their highest levels on record at more than 800,000 tonnes. Experts attribute China’s power crisis to a two-prong problem, including a coal shortage. The supply shortage in China – and in many parts of the world – has sent coal prices soaring and discouraged electricity production. Electricity rationing has also been imposed in more than half of China’s provinces, as local governments race to meet Beijing’s carbon emissions targets for the year. China coal: why is it so important to the economy? To tackle the coal supply shortage, China has not only expanded its coal trade with existing trading partners, it has started importing from non-traditional markets, like South Africa and Mozambique. China’s coal trade with South Africa, which started more than 10 years ago, was obliterated after coal from the African nation was prohibited because it was found to contain restricted trace elements like fluorine. That relationship was revived at the start of the year and China’s imports reached more than 1 million tonnes in April from zero last December. China’s coal imports from South Africa – mostly thermal coal for power generation – remained buoyed at nearly 500,000 tonnes last month, Chinese customs data shows. Like South Africa, China’s coal trade with Mozambique was active between 2011-14, but disappeared until February this year. Monthly imports from the African nation hit 174,000 tonnes in April, the highest level on record. All of this comes as China’s unofficial ban on Australian coal imports continues after it was imposed last October amid political tensions that had escalated last April when Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus without consulting Beijing. In relation to thermal coal, which is at the centre of the power crisis, China only imports about 7 per cent. hile the amount is small and not critical to China’s total consumption, overseas suppliers such as Australia – and now Kazakhstan and others – play a big role in plugging shortages as they arise. That shortage has now hit the second largest economy in the world, following years of problems in the domestic coal mining sector, such as reduced mining, closure of mines and corruption crackdowns.",2021-10-05T20:30:25+08:00,2021-10-05T19:11:06+08:00,2021-10-05T23:11:10+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3151282/china-steps-coal-imports-kazakhstan-south-africa-and,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/10/05/de78f1be-25c6-11ec-8f06-8f17bcf6e46a_image_hires_191105.jpeg?itok=-G-ZhbCa&v=1633432274,China Economy
China’s economy faces multiplying risks as shrinking factory activity points to deeper slowdown,China’s shrinking factory activity ‘sounds alarm’ on mounting risks,"['The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) – a survey of sentiment among factory owners – fell to 49.6 in September, from 50.1 in August', 'The survey points signals more trouble for China’s economy, which has been hit by crippling power cuts, high raw material prices and fresh Delta outbreaks']",Orange Wang,"China’s economy appears to have taken a turn for the worse as manufacturing activity among large firms slipped into contraction in September, sounding the alarm on a deepening slowdown amid a national electricity crunch, raw material inflation, regulatory crackdowns and fresh Delta variant outbreaks. The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) – a survey of sentiment among factory owners – fell to 49.6 in September from 50.1 in August , according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), marking a 19-month low. “The weak PMI will send an alarm to the government,” Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said. “Economic growth in the fourth quarter is likely to slow further without a change of government policies, and the pace of slowdown may pick up.” “China is undergoing a slowdown that is predictable and within the policy framework Zhou Hao Widespread power cuts that have crippled businesses and hurt households have exacerbated the soft underlying economic conditions, according to analysts. Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank, said the September manufacturing PMI showed the clear impact of coal shortfalls as upstream prices continued to rise, while the downstream output was declining. “China is undergoing a slowdown that is predictable and within the policy framework, there is likely to be a further slowdown in the coming period,” Zhou said. “Now the coal and power shortages are a core contradiction,” he said. What has caused China’s electricity shortages, and is Beijing’s carbon-neutral goal solely to blame? Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura, said the PMI would likely recover to above 50 next month – depending on power supply constraints – but it was unlikely to rise above 51. Nomura slashed its annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for China to 7.7 per cent from 8.2 per cent at the onset of the power crisis earlier this week. Production curbs on industries with high carbon emissions and high energy intensity would drag on the economy further, Lu said. Thursday’s manufacturing PMI survey showed the new order and new export order subindices fell to 49.3 and 46.2 respectively, indicating overseas demand for Chinese products has weakened, particularly as other economies slowly return to normal. Meanwhile, the subindex of raw materials soared again to 63.5 from 61.3, exerting further pressure on profit margins. “[The] survey result showed that some over 40 per cent of small companies said their raw material costs were high, funds were tight and the market demand was insufficient, parts of small firms are facing multiple difficulties,” Zhao Qinghe, senior statistician at the NBS, said in a statement on Thursday. In contrast to the official survey, the Caixin/Markit PMI released on Thursday, which focuses on small, private firms, rose from 49.2 in August to 50.0 in September. But economists warned the Caixin survey had not yet captured the negative impact of power cuts, which have hit small and medium-sized manufacturers hard , causing closures and production halts in the past week. One bright spot of news for the Chinese economy in September was a rebound in services activity, thanks to the easing of lockdowns and border closures following Delta outbreak across the country over the past two months. “The quick rebound in the services sectors reflects China’s effective pandemic control and rapid demand recovery. The positive momentum is likely to continue into the National Day holiday week in October,” said Betty Wang, an economist with ANZ Research. However, the economy remains vulnerable to further outbreaks and consequent lockdowns given Beijing’s zero-Covid strategy , Lu of Nomura said. Analysts expect policymakers in Beijing to execute targeted and low profile monetary or fiscal easing to support the Chinese economy in coming months, despite authorities holding firm on tight liquidity policy. Zhou said China’s central bank was likely to cut the benchmark interest rate by 5 basis points. The key risk to the economy is the property sector Zhang Zhiwei Nomura’s Lu forecast fifty-fifty odds of a targeted cut to the reserve requirement ratio in coming months and expected Beijing to increase fiscal spending and bond issuance, while releasing all of the remaining 2.4 trillion yuan (US$371 billion) net bond financing quota for the fourth quarter of the year. Policymakers will be keeping a close eye on resurgent coronavirus cases and high raw material costs in coming months, but some analysts say a potential slowdown in its debt-laden property sector could be the biggest challenge. “The key risk to the economy is the property sector,” said Zhang, from Pinpoint Asset Management. “The big question is whether the government monetary and fiscal policies will become more supportive now or if the government will wait till the year end to change the policies,” he said. The People’s Bank of China and China’s Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission on Wednesday held a meeting with banks to prevent the Evergrande crisis from spilling over to the whole property sector. Meanwhile, the official non-manufacturing PMI – which measures morale in the services and construction sectors – rose to 53.2 in September, from 47.5 in August. The increase was driven by a rise in the services index from 45.2 to 52.4. The construction index, though, dropped to 57.5 in September from 60.5. The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, rose to 51.7 in September from 48.9 in August.",2021-09-30T18:55:39+08:00,2021-09-30T18:55:32+08:00,2021-09-30T23:23:02+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3150763/chinas-economy-faces-multiplying-risks-shrinking-factory,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/09/30/6cda0fc0-21d9-11ec-83d0-b8338c7f9150_image_hires_195846.jpg?itok=HYKSDHM7&v=1633003136,China Economy
China’s power crisis: Beijing vows to increase coal imports and ‘strengthen adjustment of supply and demand’,Will Beijing let electricity prices be raised to stop rolling blackouts?,"['Top economic planner says coal-production capacity will be increased as critical shortage keeps prices at record highs', 'Analysts say power companies must be allowed to charge more for energy, but prices are strictly regulated under ‘planned economy’']",Cissy Zhou,"With China’s coal-fired power stations reeling from record coal prices that make electricity generation unprofitable – resulting in blackouts across the country and mounting social concerns about adequate heating this winter – Beijing vowed on Wednesday to import more coal and let electricity rates reflect supply and demand. But although authorities did not confirm whether they will lift the cap on state-controlled prices, that is exactly what analysts are saying needs to be done. It is an uncommon and potentially contentious suggestion in China, where electricity prices are largely fixed by the government – part of Beijing’s so-called planned economy – while the price of coal is highly marketised. But desperate times may be forcing authorities’ hands, given that the country is suffering from its worst power crunch in several years, and at least 20 out of 31 provincial jurisdictions have implemented electricity-rationing measures. Households have been left without power during peak usage periods, traffic lights have failed in some cities, and the industrial and manufacturing sectors have been crippled by strict operating restrictions. Since January, the price of thermal coal – used to generate electricity – has shot up by nearly two-thirds, from about 670 yuan (US$104) per tonne to around 1,100 yuan (US$170), amid strong demand and limited supply. China’s major power-generation companies simply cannot afford to buy coal at that price, so they have drastically cut electricity output. As demand for coal surges, how long can Beijing keep banning Australian supply? In response to the crisis, China’s top economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said on Wednesday that it would “take multiple measures to strengthen the adjustment of supply and demand”, without revealing details on any planned price reforms. “The price of electricity and gas for people’s livelihoods will remain basically stable, in strict accordance with the price policy,” it said. Power is usually sold at regulated rates, which provinces are allowed to raise or lower by as much as 10 per cent. Several provinces have already added the maximum 10 per cent, so subsequent increases may have to be substantial to offset the sky-high coal prices. The NDRC previously indicated in July that it would change the way it sets residential electricity prices to better reflect power supply costs. Lin Boqiang, a professor of energy policy at Xiamen University, said the NDRC should either raise electricity prices or encourage coal mines to boost output in the near term, to address the worsening problem. The NDRC also said on Wednesday that it would “release advanced coal production capacity”, “ensure that coal-electric power units are fully distributed” and “ increase coal imports in an orderly manner”. From January to August, China’s power production rose by 11.3 per cent, year on year, but its coal production increased by only 4.4 per cent in the same period, according to official data. Lin said that the power grids and power companies in China are unprofitable or barely profitable, and considering current costs, the price of residential electricity should be doubled. But he said China is likely to raise the price for only industrial electricity. “Power companies have to be able to turn a profit, and this problem must be solved,” he said. In an interview this week with Chinese media outlet Jiemian, Lin also said that increasing electricity prices is a long-term process that needs to be done in small increments. “For example, if it is expected to rise 50 per cent, the authorities could increase by 5 per cent at first,” he said. “It is impossible to do it in one fell swoop, because they have to try to reduce the impact on economic activities and people’s lives.” Coal-power companies are using excuses … to reduce or even cancel the power output of the units, resulting in a significant drop in power output load Sinolink Securities On Sunday, Hunan’s top economic planner said it was planning to unveil a trial programme to link industrial power prices to the coal market, starting in October. The official document was widely circulated on Chinese social media and was confirmed by China Business News on Wednesday. Once the coal price surpasses 900 yuan per tonne, the cost for coal-fired power companies exceeds 0.38 yuan per kWh, which is higher than the nation’s average on-grid price – the price of on-grid electricity settled between power-generation firms and power buyers – of coal power of about 0.35 yuan per kWh, meaning coal-power enterprises lose more than 0.03 yuan for every unit of electricity they generate, according to Sinolink Securities. The securities firm estimated that, for every 50 yuan per tonne increase in the price of coal, the cost for coal-power firms rises by about 0.02 yuan per kWh. “As a result, coal-power companies are using excuses – including temporary maintenance, [inadequate coal quality], etc – to reduce or even cancel the power output of the units, resulting in a significant drop in power output load,” the firm said in a report. @LantauGroup has just published our watching brief on the Chinese power shortages.

Shi Xunpeng, principal research fellow at the University of Technology Sydney, also commented on the surging coal prices and their impact on the market. “China puts a strict cap on electricity prices,” he said. “As a result, coal-fired power companies would argue that they cannot find the very coal that could cover their costs, and it will definitely trigger problems. “That’s why we say China’s transformation may be more difficult than that of other countries, because it involves an adjustment of the pricing mechanism.”",2021-09-30T06:00:14+08:00,2021-09-29T22:41:52+08:00,2021-09-30T11:20:47+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3150634/chinas-power-crisis-beijing-vows-increase-coal-imports-and,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/09/30/1b5e6c12-212b-11ec-83d0-b8338c7f9150_image_hires_112045.jpg?itok=cWk4geMC&v=1632972057,China Economy
"China GDP: economic growth tipped to slow amid coronavirus, property crackdown and debt reduction campaign","China GDP growth tipped to slow as economy hit by virus, property headwinds","['Regulatory tightening in the property sector, deleveraging efforts and recurrent Covid-19 outbreaks are among the factors dragging on growth', 'Analysts in a Bloomberg survey are predicting a 3.6 per cent expansion in the fourth quarter, down from 4.9 per cent in the previous quarter']",Amanda Lee,"China’s economic growth is likely to slow further in the last quarter of 2021 amid fallout from the Evergrande crisis and a resurgence of Covid-19 outbreaks, according to analysts. The world’s second largest economy is expected to report its gross domestic product (GDP) figures for last year on Monday, with analysts in a Bloomberg survey predicting a 3.6 per cent expansion in the fourth quarter, down from 4.9 per cent in the previous quarter. GDP growth for 2021 is likely to be 8 per cent, according to the Bloomberg poll. The Chinese government set a modest target of “above 6 per cent” growth for this year . China revised down its 2020 growth rate to 2.2 per cent year on year, down from 2.3 per cent. “In the near term, the property market slowdown remains the biggest threat to macroeconomic and financial stability in China,” said US investment bank JP Morgan in a research note this week. Real estate investment directly contributes 14-15 per cent of GDP, including construction and residential property development, and about 25 per cent of GDP if taking into account upstream and downstream sectors, JP Morgan estimated. Beijing’s tough policy for reducing debt in the property sector has triggered a crisis at developer China Evergrande Group, while its peers such as Shimao could see a credit crunch in the coming month as a result of regulatory restrictions in financing. “The company [Shimao] is facing heightened refinancing risks due to still-tight regulatory conditions, apart from the materially weakened capital markets access,” said S&P Global Ratings in a note to announce its downgrade of the developer this week. “We don’t believe the company will be able to access capital markets in the next six months given the volatility in prices of its capital market instruments, both domestically and offshore.” China’s economy had a robust start in 2021 driven by strong growth in exports, but began to lose steam in the second half amid a series of regulatory clampdowns in the real estate, technology and education sectors. To rein in its red-hot housing market, China looks to Zunyi The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have already downgraded China’s growth forecast to 8 per cent for 2021 from previous estimates of 8.5 per cent and 8.1 per cent respectively. They cited diminished support from exports and the government’s continued deleveraging efforts , recurrent Covid-19 outbreaks and lockdown measures among the factors dragging on growth. China’s factory activity unexpectedly accelerated again in December, but the slender margin of growth highlights the pressure the economy is facing early this year, with policymakers under pressure to offer more support measures. The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 50.3 in December , up from 50.1 in November, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. Although China enjoyed a strong trade performance in 2021, signs of an overall economic slowdown were highlighted by decelerating import and export growth in December. In the final month of 2021, exports grew by 20.9 per cent from a year earlier to US$340.498 billion, down from the 22 per cent growth in November. Imports, meanwhile, rose by 19.5 per cent in December from a year earlier, to US$246.035 billion – down from the 31.7 per cent growth in November. Beijing pledged to “front-load” policies to shore up the economy next year at the tone-setting annual central economic work conference that concluded in December. While alarm bells are ringing in regards to economic growth prospects, analysts believe policymakers are not likely to pull out all the stops immediately when it comes to easing. Beijing is expected to take a gradual approach, rather than rush into expanding fiscal and monetary measures. How age-old prejudice is fuelling worker shortages in China’s factories “It doesn’t mean that regulation has come to an end, but it does mean that peak of regulation, peak of property tightening and peak of decarbonisation are behind us. In 2022, policymakers have more important things to do, i.e. defending the 5 per cent growth bottom line,” said Macquarie Capital in a note last week. Credit conditions remain tight even though the People’s Bank of China lowered the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points and the one-year loan prime rate by 5 basis points in December. Beijing is also likely to keep a tight grip on local government debt, which could dampen infrastructure spending – an important driver of economic growth – by scrutinising local government financial vehicles (LGFVs) in a bid to curb off-balance borrowing. “Due to the cooling of land sales, fiscal revenue [for local governments] in 2022 may be affected, local financial pressure will increase, and the risk of bonds [default] by LGFVs may rise compared with 2021,” said China Merchant Bank in a research note on Tuesday. Despite weak consumer demand, the Chinese government is also likely to stick with its zero-Covid stance throughout 2022. China is now trying to contain clusters of the highly infectious Omicron strain as well as the Delta variant in multiple cities and provinces, with the Lunar New Year holiday and Beijing Winter Olympics just weeks away. “China’s production has remained resilient under the current health control measures, with drags mainly on local consumption and services activity,” said JP Morgan. “Exports and foreign direct investment both reached new historical highs in 2021, and there is no reason to expect better performance with a shift to a living with Covid policy.”",2022-01-15T02:00:19+08:00,2022-01-14T16:26:34+08:00,2022-01-15T02:37:32+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3163411/china-gdp-economic-growth-tipped-slow-amid-coronavirus,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/14/7caf57be-5a6c-476f-b8c4-b3b27181d3a3_486646b4.jpg?itok=ZU4MOedi&v=1642148800,China Economy
US inflation hits 39-year high of 7 per cent,US inflation hits 39-year high of 7 per cent,"['Consumer prices in 2021 rose by the most in nearly four decades, setting the stage for the start of Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes', 'High inflation has proven more stubborn than the central bank predicted, as unprecedented demand for goods runs into supply constraints']",Bloomberg,"US consumer prices soared last year by the most in nearly four decades, illustrating red-hot inflation that sets the stage for the start of Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes as soon as March. The consumer price index climbed 7 per cent in 2021, the largest 12-month gain since June 1982, according to Labour Department data released on Wednesday. The widely followed inflation gauge rose 0.5 per cent from November, exceeding forecasts. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, so-called core prices accelerated from a month earlier, rising by a larger-than-forecast 0.6 per cent. The measure jumped 5.5 per cent from a year earlier, the biggest advance since 1991. The increase in the CPI was led by higher prices for shelter and used vehicles. Food costs also contributed. Energy prices, which were a key driver of inflation through most of 2021, fell last month. The data bolster expectations that the Fed will begin raising interest rates in March, a sharp policy adjustment from the timeline projected just a few months ago. High inflation has proven more stubborn and widespread than the central bank predicted amid unprecedented demand for goods along with capacity constraints related to the supply of both labour and materials. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has now fallen below 4 per cent. Against this evolving backdrop, some Fed policymakers have said that it could be appropriate to begin shrinking the central bank’s balance sheet soon after raising rates. Market expectations for Fed tightening expected in March and 2022 as a whole were largely unchanged after the report. Yields on 10-year Treasuries remained lower with the dollar, while the S&P 500 opened higher. World Bank sees sharp slowdown for global economy, cuts US, China forecasts “In terms of where the Fed is on their dual mandate – inflation and the labour market – they’re basically there,” Michael Gapen, chief US economist at Barclays, said on Bloomberg Television. “I don’t really think anything stops them going in March except one of these kind of outlier events. I think they’re ready.” The energy index declined 0.4 per cent from November, the first monthly decline since April as petrol prices slid. Food inflation climbed 0.5 per cent, a slight deceleration from the previous month due to falling costs for meats. “What we have now is a mismatch between demand and supply. We have very strong demand in areas where supply is constrained, particularly around goods, particularly around things like cars,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday. Desperate to fill open positions, businesses are increasing pay to attract and retain workers, particularly at the lower end. But rising prices are eroding those wage advances. Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings dropped 2.4 per cent in December from a year earlier, the biggest drop since May, separate data showed on Wednesday. However, compared with a month earlier, they rose 0.1 per cent, the first gain in three months. Shelter costs – which are considered to be a more structural component of the CPI and make up about a third of the overall index – rose 0.4 per cent from the prior month. Other gauges of home prices and rents have surged last year, likely presaging a sharp acceleration in the report’s housing metrics this year and offering an enduring tailwind to inflation. Omicron – the dominant Covid-19 variant in the US – is poised to further disrupt already fragile supply chains as quarantines and illness prevent some employees from going to work. Spending on services like travel may slow, pushing down prices, but goods prices may move higher. Biden says US on right track in Covid-19 fight as new cases hit 1.35 million Nonetheless, the impact is expected to be temporary. Economists expect CPI growth to moderate to around 3 per cent over the course of 2022, which will depend on supply chains normalising and energy prices levelling off. However, higher rents, robust wage growth, subsequent waves of Covid-19 and lingering supply constraints all pose upside risks to the inflation outlook. The persistently high inflation is also likely to maintain a high hurdle for President Joe Biden and Democrats to revive their roughly US$2 trillion tax-and-spending package, after a key lawmaker, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, objected to the legislation in part because of the surge in prices. On a December-December basis, the increase in the CPI was the largest advance since 1981. The inflation environment changed markedly in 2021 compared with the prior year when a pandemic-related slowdown in demand led to the smallest calendar-year gain in the CPI since 2015.",2022-01-13T02:30:34+08:00,2022-01-13T02:30:31+08:00,2022-01-13T03:14:02+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3163166/us-inflation-hits-39-year-high-7-cent,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/13/62442ea3-01c6-406c-91cb-de0dd1862f13_1f7c277f.jpg?itok=gGHetVM7&v=1642012232,United States & Canada
"HKMA, Hong Kong’s de facto central bank, proposes regulating fiat currency-backed stablecoins with rules...",HKMA proposes regulating stablecoin issuers like banks,"['The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is seeking public views on rules that would license and supervise stablecoin activities like banks', 'Usually pegged to the US dollar, the US$150 billion stablecoin market is growing as a means of payment, necessitating regulatory framework, says the HKMA']",Georgina Lee,"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched a consultation seeking public feedback on regulating stablecoins, as it aims to counter the growing risks such fiat currency-backed digital tokens pose to the city’s financial system. In proposing to regulate the US$150 billion global stablecoin market, which includes tether and USD Coin that are pegged to the US dollar, the HKMA has acknowledged that stablecoins could become a widely accepted means of payment. This is in contrast to its long-held position that bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalisation of US$809 billion, is not a means of payment, but a mere “commodity” . “There is growing interest of banks and their customers in exploring opportunities in investing in crypto-assets,” the HKMA said in a discussion paper released on Wednesday, adding that there is a need to ensure that stablecoins are appropriately regulated before they are marketed to the public. The HKMA’s proposal to regulate stablecoins comes just three months after the city’s de facto central bank announced plans to explore its own digital currency, the e-HKD , for retail use. While a central bank would fully back its own sovereign digital currency, including its settlement, many observers are sceptical about whether stablecoins are genuinely backed “one-to-one” by a US dollar reserve as claimed by the private entities behind them. To bring stablecoins under its jurisdiction, the HKMA is considering whether to expand the scope of the existing “payment systems and stored value facilitates ordinance”, which governs operators of e-wallets and prepaid cards and use it to also cover stablecoin activities, or introduce a new law. What is a stable coin? Given that a stablecoin generally involves more than one entity to create and operate, the HKMA has proposed that operators involved in the issuance, reserve management, record keeping, private key storage and transaction of stablecoins would all need to be regulated through licensing. These entities could be subject to rules governing capital and liquidity adequacies, requirements on how they should manage the reserve assets backing the stablecoins, compliance with anti-money-laundering and counter-financing of terrorism rules and financial reporting. The HKMA said it was also seeking views on whether all stablecoin issuers should be regulated under the city’s banking ordinance akin to banks. This would mirror the approach proposed by the administration of US President Joe Biden , which wants to impose bank-like regulations on entities that issue stablecoins. The US$150 billion market cap of stablecoins as of December accounted for about 5 per cent of the overall crypto-asset market, according to crypto data provider CoinMarketCap. Stablecoins are widely used for decentralised finance , or DeFi, which enables their holders to lend them out to third party blockchain platforms in return for a yield. Between 2020 and 2021, DeFi users and investors lost over US$12 billion due to theft and fraud , according to crypto analytics provider Elliptic. Meanwhile, the amount of money handled by related services, which include managing stablecoins and other crypto assets, grew 18-fold over the past year to US$247 billion. The HKMA said its consultation is open until the end of March and that it plans to introduce the new regime by 2024.",2022-01-12T21:09:27+08:00,2022-01-12T21:05:24+08:00,2022-01-12T21:09:27+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3163139/hkma-hong-kongs-de-facto-central-bank-proposes-regulating,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/12/86355ff7-fc8e-41f1-8dde-7066269a811b_04931316.jpg?itok=FHrJ7Im0&v=1641992727,Banking & Finance
"China’s population crisis can be solved only by printing trillions of yuan to boost birth rate, prominent...",Is printing trillions of yuan the ‘only solution’ to China’s population woes?,"['Controversial comments by Ren Zeping suggest that US$314 billion would help add 50 million kids over a decade, in part by relying on older Chinese women to give birth', 'But demographers and state media throw cold water on Ren’s idea, warning of inflation risks and pointing to failed attempts in other countries']",Luna Sun,"One of China’s most high-profile economists says the central bank should print 2 trillion yuan (US$314 billion) to help boost low fertility rates – a controversial suggestion that has sparked widespread discussion. Ren Zeping, China Evergrande Group’s former chief economist, offered his solutions to China’s low birth rate and rapidly ageing population , in an article published on Monday. “The central bank [should] print an extra 2 trillion yuan to encourage society to have 50 million more kids in 10 years,” Ren said, adding that the money would be roughly 2 to 3 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). “This can solve China’s low-birth and ageing-population problems and energise the future without burdening people, companies and local governments. Based on our studies, this is the only, and the most practical, solution.” Baby bonus: Chinese firm offers cash and extra leave for expecting parents He also urged China to establish the fund as quickly as possible, so older women who remain fertile can take advantage of it. “The reason is simple,” Ren said. “People born between 1975 and 1985 are still conditioned to believe that more children are a blessing, while people born after the 1990s are not even willing to get married , let alone have two or three children.” His urgings came as the world’s second-largest economy has been grappling with record low birth rates and a growing number of women increasingly reluctant to get married or have children. In 2020, China’s births fell by 18 per cent from 2019, marking a near six-decade low. Some regions recorded births falling by more than 10 per cent. Central and local governments have rolled out a raft of policy changes and financial support measures to encourage Chinese couples to procreate, yet public sentiment often points to the fact that children are a costly and taxing addition for most families. Some private companies are also offering cash and leave bonuses for couples who are expecting a child. But despite such initiatives, analysts have said that China’s population may have peaked in 2021 , and that the country must brace for a population decline. Ren said that mild and general policies are ineffective, and that robust measures must be implemented to address the falling birth rate. “In the past, we printed money to stimulate real estate and were left with high property prices,” he said. “If we print money to encourage childbirth, we will be left with a batch of young people.” Chinese county plays Cupid: new database aims to boost marriage, birth rates Despite an outpouring of criticism from the public and analysts, some of whom suggested that Ren’s ideas were impractical and lacked common sense, he doubled down on them during a live-stream broadcast on Monday evening. Encouraging births by printing money will become the reality in the next years, he argued. Chinese demographer Liang Jianzhang had suggested a day earlier that the government should allocate 5 trillion yuan – nearly 5 per cent of the country’s GDP – for encouraging childbirth, housing stipends and childcare facilities. Unlike with Ren’s money-printing option, Liang suggested that the 5 trillion yuan come from the fiscal budget. Economists and analysts pounced on Ren’s comments with their own critical assessments. The Beijing News published an op-ed arguing that Ren’s money-printing strategy was a far cry from basic economic principles and would lead to inflation, thus further driving up the cost of raising children. It’s medically ignorant to count on 40- and 50-year-old women to ramp up birth rates Yi Fuxian, demographer Hong Hao, chief strategist at Bank of Communications, pointed to the United States and Japan in refuting the impact that printing money has on birth rates. “Examples from abroad have proved that printing money has nothing to do with birth rates, and setting up a special fund would be useless,” Hong said. “In the industrialised age, population growth is of least concern because you can’t turn the tide.” Yi Fuxian, a demographer and senior scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, also noted how it is increasingly difficult for women to have children as they get older. Between 56 and 65 per cent of births in China are by women aged 20-29, he said. “It’s medically ignorant to count on 40- and 50-year-old women to ramp up birth rates,” Yi said.",2022-01-11T21:30:17+08:00,2022-01-11T19:22:26+08:00,2022-01-11T21:30:17+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3162974/chinas-population-crisis-can-be-solved-only-printing,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/11/08c6aa10-5946-4aa6-81d1-3a661d38aad7_1025079e.jpg?itok=pb235Tg0&v=1641900156,China Economy

The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is likely to step up cash injections through open market operations into the banking system from the second half of the month. The moves are intended to meet rising demand for cash from both companies and households ahead of the week-long holiday, which starts from January 31, the official newspaper reported. it is likely to use various policy tools including reverse repos and medium-term lending facility to meet institutions’ reasonable funding demand and to tide over the Lunar New Year holiday smoothly China Securities Journal “Many financial institutions believe it is certain that the central bank will maintain reasonably ample liquidity … and the it is likely to use various policy tools including reverse repos and medium-term lending facility to meet institutions’ reasonable funding demand and to tide over the Lunar New Year holiday smoothly,” the newspaper said. Ming Ming, chief economist at Citic Securities, expects the liquidity gap in the banking system to reach 2.6 trillion yuan (US$409 billion) in January. The financial system is also likely to face additional strains, with another 500 billion yuan worth of medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans due to expire this month, according to official data, and China’s struggling developers facing a string of bond repayment deadlines. Nomura estimates that Chinese developers have some 210 billion yuan (US$33 billion) worth of onshore and offshore bonds maturing in the first quarter of this year, which could weigh on both liquidity and market sentiment.

Yields on China’s benchmark 10-year government bonds fell last month to their lowest level since June 2020. Zhang Xu, chief analyst at Everbright Securities, said that reflected the market’s “extremely optimistic expectations” of more monetary easing. “We believe the chances of a rate cut is not high.

"Despite currency woes, Turkey may be right to cut interest rates","Despite lira woes, Turkey may be right to cut interest rates",,Joe Zhang,"Despite widespread ridicule, Turkey is persisting with reductions of its benchmark interest rates. While this may have contributed to the sharp declines in the exchange rates of the Turkish lira, it may prove to be a very sensible policy over time. Turkey’s economy is in a tough spot: inflation is at double-digit rates; foreign exchange reserves are less than plentiful; and the corporate sector has to navigate a turbulent business environment. But, when there are many competing policy objectives, it is crucial for the government to focus on the most important one. Turkey has chosen domestic production over and above exchange rates and I think that is a wise move. In 1997-98, a more severe currency crisis raged through Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia, bankrupting countless businesses and making millions jobless. The three governments sought assistance from the International Monetary Fund. But the IMF imposed harsh “conditionalities” on its bailout funding, forcing these countries to raise interest rates and tighten fiscal expenditures. However, instead of stemming capital flight, higher interest rates only caused a sharp contraction of economic activities and even more hardships. Only years later were the conditionalities relaxed and the three countries allowed more breathing space. There is now a consensus that the austerity in those years was counterproductive. What we also learned through the crisis is that exchange rates are not the most important policy objective in a chaotic situation. During a time of uncertainty, you cannot expect to attract hot money inflows just because your interest rates are a few percentage points higher. And hot money is not helpful to your fundamental economy anyway. Some policy analysts (myself included) argue that if a lower exchange rate is a nuisance enough, the government should consider imposing controls on capital flows rather than trying to lure hot money with stifling interest rates. No one likes currency controls, but it is a lesser evil than high interest rates. To convince domestic residents to hang on to their lira savings, Turkey last week offered a compensation plan in the event of further lira depreciation. That may work well in the medium-to-long term. In 1988-92, China implemented a much bolder compensation programme for bank savers in the wake of double-digit inflation and a runaway currency crisis despite strict currency controls. A grey market for foreign exchange had been rampant throughout the 1980s and 1990s, so much so that the central bank had to issue “foreign exchange certificates” to trade separately from, and in parallel to, the officially sanctioned foreign exchange market, and in recognition of street vendors who openly traded foreign currencies. More relevant to the Turkish situation, China offered all household deposits (but not corporate deposits) that were longer than one year in maturity full compensation based on the monthly consumer price index. So, in some months, the compensation was more than 10 percentage points. But still, the central bank always kept its lending rates stable, or unchanged at 6-8 per cent in those years, forcing credit rationing and worsening corruption. And the negative interest rate margin also became a huge burden on all state-owned banks. Observers often make the mistake of focusing only on real interest rates. The reality is that nominal interest rates are also important. After all, business is conducted on nominal interest rates and borrowers pay nominal interest rates. When the benchmark interest rate stood at double-digit rates, Turkey’s corporate borrowers could not breathe, and rate cuts are only sensible. If unintended consequences such as a lira decline (and imported inflation) can be mitigated somehow, that would be terrific. Otherwise, just ignore them. After all, expanding domestic production is the ultimate way to bring down inflation.

The announcement on Monday comes as Beijing looks for ways to manage “ possible spillover ” from an imminent rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and promote investment across Belt and Road Initiative countries. “We’ll strengthen the support for the construction of Hong Kong as an offshore yuan hub, and promote the healthy development of offshore centres,” the PBOC said in an online statement. Hong Kong is China’s vital link to the world, financial regulators say Hong Kong, which had end-October deposits of 834.9 billion yuan (US$130.9 billion) and accounted for 46 per cent of China’s cross-border payments last year, is a key international financial centre for Beijing, though it will be integrated more tightly with mainland cities under the Greater Bay Area plan, which includes Guangdong province and Macau. Hong Kong’s close economic connection with the mainland, including its stock, bond, and wealth management connect programmes, give it an edge over other offshore yuan centres like Singapore and London. The central bank did not elaborate on what policy support the special administrative region would receive, but there is huge potential for the issuance of yuan-denominated financial products, trade settlement and use of the digital yuan. Zhou Xiaochuan, former central bank governor who masterminded the yuan’s international use, said over the weekend that China should reconsider establishment of an international board in Shanghai, which is positioned to be a global yuan asset centre. “Many companies in belt and road countries have difficulty in equity or bond financing,” Zhou said at the Shanghai International Financial Centre Development Forum on Saturday. “China should start from this and allow qualified foreign companies to raise funds from the Chinese stock market.” That, however, will require a higher level of capital account convertibility to facilitate massive inflows and outflows, he said. The Ministry of Finance issued 20 billion yuan of bonds in three tranches in Hong Kong this year, while the PBOC sold 5 billion yuan of central bank bills to international investors last week. US coronavirus stimulus reignites Beijing’s criticism of dollar hegemony Beijing kicked off its yuan internationalisation plan in 2009 with hopes of breaking US dollar hegemony , but the goal has gained more importance since 2018 amid fears Washington may tighten access to the US-dominated financial system. International use of the yuan is making slow progress, but it remains far behind the US dollar in terms of international payments, reserve currency and forex transactions. The yuan accounted for 2.14 per cent of global payments in November, fifth overall, compared with 40.39 per cent for the US dollar and 33.52 per cent for the euro, according to SWIFT. At the annual conference, the central bank also outlined plans for more diversified investment in its US$3.2 trillion foreign exchange reserves, most of which are in US dollar assets, including US$1.06 trillion of US treasury bills. The PBOC vowed to increase the elasticity of yuan exchange rate to absorb potential external shocks, while pledging more financial opening and “basic stability” of the Chinese currency. The world’s second largest economy will continue to advance its pilot programme for the digital yuan, which it hopes will boost overseas use of the currency. The PBOC has teamed up with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, as well as its counterparts in Thailand and the United Arab Emirates to study cross-border payments of digital currencies. In a separate meeting held Monday, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, China’s currency regulator, said it will continue opening the capital account in a steady and orderly manner. Multinational companies will be able to enlarge their yuan holdings for easier exchanges, while Beijing will consider a trial programme to let private equity funds invest overseas. However, the regulator said it was still on high alert for external shocks. “We’ll enhance monitoring and macroprudential management of forex markets,” it said. “Particular attention will be given to small and medium-sized exporters, which need to be guided in managing exchange rate risks.”",2021-12-28T18:15:11+08:00,2021-12-28T17:55:01+08:00,2021-12-28T18:15:11+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3161288/china-strengthen-hong-kong-yuan-trading-hub-diversify-forex,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/28/cf8470f5-afac-47ae-901d-535b425cc941_7d3a11b8.jpg?itok=feEe5np_&v=1640685305,China Economy
China injects US$31 billion into financial system to alleviate rising liquidity pressure,China injects US$31 billion into financial system as liquidity demand rises,"['Cash injection sees 200 billion yuan added through seven-day reverse repurchase agreements', 'Liquidity conditions in China tend to tighten toward the end of the year, as banks hoard cash to prepare for regulatory checks']",Bloomberg,"China has boosted its injection of short-term cash into the banking system to the highest level in two months, as demand for liquidity climbed before year end. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) added 200 billion yuan (US$31 billion) worth of cash into the financial system through seven-day reverse repurchase agreements, more than offsetting the 10 billion yuan coming due. The move came after an indicator for short-term borrowing costs soared the most in a year on Monday – a sign of liquidity shortages in the interbank market. “The big injection will help alleviate liquidity pressure,” said Zhaopeng Xing, senior strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking. “It is necessary to help financial institutions move cross the year end smoothly.” China to stem yuan rise amid ‘uncertainties, instability and imbalance’ Liquidity conditions in China tend to tighten toward the end of the year, as banks hoard cash to prepare for regulatory checks. The PBOC reduced the reserve-requirement ratio earlier this month in an effort to keep cash supply ample and support the nation’s economic recovery from the pandemic. In its quarterly meeting, the central bank pledged to use monetary policy tools more “proactively” to support growth. The seven-day repo rate had fallen rate by 15 basis points to 2.27 per cent on Tuesday afternoon, after soaring 52 basis points on Monday. The costs on the contracts of the same tenor in the exchange market dropped to 5.2 per cent, from the highest close since January in the previous session. “The net injection will likely continue for the rest of this week,” said Peiqian Liu, China economist at NatWest Markets. With the PBOC’s rhetoric in December leaning toward the dovish side, signalling Beijing’s concerns about the near-term outlook on growth, China should be willing to use broad-based easing tools to aid the economy, she added.",2021-12-28T15:27:07+08:00,2021-12-28T15:27:03+08:00,2021-12-28T15:31:12+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3161264/china-injects-us31-billion-financial-system-alleviate-rising,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/28/5843af55-9bf2-4da0-ab3b-1de3ab5a99b5_971c8430.jpg?itok=1tkE49-x&v=1640676427,China Economy
Why the Federal Reserve is taking a modest approach to raising interest rates,What’s driving the Fed’s modest approach to raising interest rates?,,Tai Hui,"The US Federal Reserve is ending 2021 with a bang, accelerating its policy normalisation and predicting raising interest rates earlier than previously anticipated. While inflation is an immediate concern , there are constraints on how aggressive the Fed could be in raising interest rates in the long run. In its latest monetary policy setting meeting, the Fed said it will reduce asset purchases by US$30 billion each month, instead of by US$15 billion as announced in November . This implies its quantitative easing programme will end in March instead of June. It is also forecasting three policy rate hikes in 2022 instead of just the one in its September forecast. The first rise could come as early as June. Given that US inflation has hit a multi-decade high, the Fed’s more aggressive policy-tightening stance is not surprising. However, its projection for policy rate increases in 2023 and 2024 is still modest. Even with the unemployment rate forecast to fall below the long-term projection of 4 per cent, the Fed only expects to raise the policy rate two to three times a year. Why? One explanation is that inflation will decline as the world normalises. Supply chain disruptions should be resolved in the next six to 12 months. Energy prices should also stabilise. However, other constraints could keep the Fed’s policy rates low in the long run. The US federal government’s rising fiscal debt is one factor. According to the US Congressional Budget Office, gross federal debt has exceeded US$28.5 trillion, with over US$22 trillion held by the public. Debt held by the public is equivalent to 102 per cent of GDP, compared to 35 per cent of GDP in 2007 before the global financial crisis. Hence, the financial crisis and the pandemic have led to a surge in US government debt. This is not a burden on the government’s budget when interest rates are low. The current government bond yield implies that the US government only needs to pay 1.5 per cent on a 10-year loan. However, with limited projected growth in revenue and the rise in social security and health care spending, federal government debt will continue to rise. The CBO projects that the debt held by the public will rise from 102 per cent of GDP in 2021 to over 140 per cent in 2040. The net interest cost of servicing this debt would rise from 1.4 per cent of GDP in 2021 to 5 per cent in 2040, assuming 10-year government bond yields rise from the current 1.5 per cent to 3.8 per cent. These ratios mean the US federal government could spend US$2.2 trillion by 2040 on net interest payments alone, compared with US$3 billion in 2021, assuming bond yields are allowed to rise significantly. This would take away important resources from essential government spending, such as health care and social support. Another challenge is that the federal government could get stuck in a debt spiral. If interest rates are higher than the pace of nominal economic growth, even if the federal government manages to balance the budget every year, the overall government debt to GDP ratio would rise. This challenge can be overcome in three ways. The government could spend less or raise taxes, to run a budget surplus and reduce debt. This, however, does not seem likely in the current political environment. As US debt piles up, what happens if faith in Treasuries is shaken? Second, the economy could grow faster, which would require quicker productivity growth or labour growth. But US demographics and the current fiscal revenue and spending structure make these options less likely. An easy way out would be to keep interest rates lower for longer. While the Fed is independent and targets price stability and full employment, a deterioration in the government’s fiscal position could be seen as a threat to economic growth, which would endanger the job market. Hence, the Fed could be inclined to keep rates low in the long run. Even as the Fed prepares to raise rates in 2022, America’s fiscal position could be a bind on how far the central bank could go in the long run. For investors in Asia, cash returns are still likely to be weak and fall behind inflation. Generating income could remain an ongoing theme in constructing portfolios.

China’s economic downturn ramps up urgency for Beijing to keep market expectations in check,"Beijing vows to manage market expectations amid headwinds, growing pessimism","['China’s GDP growth seen weakening to 2.9 per cent in first-quarter 2022, Nomura economist forecasts', 'Beijing is urged to be cautious in introducing policies that have a contractionary effect']",Ji Siqi,"China has pledged to keep market expectations anchored and manageable in the coming year, according to a senior economic official, despite strong headwinds and growing pessimism about the nation’s economic outlook. “There have been fluctuations in terms of market expectations and corporate confidence,” Ning Jizhe, deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, the country’s top economic planner, said in an interview with Xinhua published on Tuesday. “The importance of keeping expectations stable has become more prominent.” He specifically pointed to “uncertainties” surrounding economic operations amid the ongoing pandemic. In an official statement following China’s annual central economic work conference this month, “weaker expectations” were said to be contributing to the “threefold pressure” facing China’s economy, along with “contraction of demand” and “supply shocks”. How may local government debt hinder Beijing’s attempts to shore up economy? Despite Beijing’s recent easing in its macroeconomy policy stance, market concerns over China’s economic downturn persist. The nation’s economic growth is expected to weaken further in spring 2022 due to a worsening property sector , the rising costs of China’s zero-Covid strategy , a downturn in exports , and widespread factory closures before and during the upcoming Winter Olympics, Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura, said in a report earlier this month. Lu expected gross domestic product (GDP) growth to slow further to 2.9 per cent, year on year, in the first quarter of 2022, compared with 18.3 per cent growth in the first quarter this year due to a lower comparison base in 2020. “Beijing’s [economic policy] easing in 2022 would stand in sharp contrast with most other economies,” he said. In the interview with Xinhua, Ning also said that China should effectively evaluate the potential impact of economic policies before they are rolled out, and that Beijing must be cautious in introducing policies that have a contractionary effect – a point that another senior economic policymaker, Han Wenxiu , also warned about earlier this month. In the past year, Beijing rolled out reforms and regulatory crackdowns on various sectors, including technology , education and real estate , along with a push for “ common prosperity ”, and that heavy-handed approach has sparked concerns among global investors. Thus, it is important for the government to guide enterprises and residents to interpret the policies appropriately, so as not to cause confusion, according to Li Xunlei, chief economist and head of Zhongtai Securities’ research institute. “It’s normal to have ‘weakening expectations’,” Li wrote in a note on Tuesday. “Service sector consumption, such as for travel and entertainment, has dropped significantly due to the pandemic, and the expected return on investment has also fallen due to the economic slowdown, which has further dragged down the willingness to invest.” Li said China has made strides in recent years when it comes to managing expectations to avoid surprising developments in macroeconomic policies. For example, the People’s Bank of China gave clear signals ahead of its two reserve requirement ratio cuts this year. ‘Firewalls’ needed to protect China from economic risks, central bank says As for privately owned enterprises, it is important for the government to emphasise that China will “unswervingly encourage, support and guide” their development, Li added. “Make sure all private enterprises are convinced that common prosperity is a long-term goal based on ‘making the cake bigger’, so private enterprises will further increase their willingness to invest,” he said. Ding Shuang, chief Greater China economist at Standard Chartered Bank, said that although the policy signals have been clear, further quantitative guidance is essential to guide the market and boost investor confidence. “So far, we have many qualitative descriptions on boosting confidence, but there is a lack of quantitative discussion on specific policies, such as the expected growth target, the size of the fiscal deficit, and the credit growth rate,” Ding said.",2021-12-22T22:15:41+08:00,2021-12-22T18:57:15+08:00,2021-12-22T23:04:01+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3160714/chinas-economic-downturn-ramps-urgency-beijing-keep,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/22/e9e0ac26-1d2c-45ee-9ea4-b63463b9d193_a1318541.jpg?itok=-AY7eWHA&v=1640170639,Economic Indicators
China denies ‘despicable’ banknote forgery worth US$314 billion as alleged scam goes viral,‘It’s despicable’: central bank denies banknote forgery worth US$314 billion,"['Chen Yaoming, a board director of the China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation, turned himself in to authorities earlier this month', 'His detention started trending online on Wednesday amid rumours he had privately minted 2 trillion yuan (US$314 billion) of banknotes']",Frank Tang,"China’s central bank on Wednesday denied a “despicable” rumour that a former senior official had forged 2 trillion yuan (US$314 billion) of banknotes after the allegation began trending on social media. Chen Yaoming, a board director of the China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation, an affiliate of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), turned himself in to authorities earlier this month. He is being investigated by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the country’s top anti-corruption agency, under suspicion he “severely violated” ethics and laws. While details of his charges have not been disclosed, his detention became a topic of intrigue on messaging app WeChat and microblogging platform Weibo on Wednesday, prompting the PBOC to report the speculation to police. ‘No doubt’ serious easing cycle ahead for China after benchmark rate cut Some social media users said Chen had been arrested for printing banknotes with the same serial numbers as other notes. The online rumours were false and “despicable”, the central bank said in a statement. “There are strict working procedures and technical standards for the printing and issuance of [the yuan],” it said. “The People’s Bank of China has been doing it in accordance with laws and regulations.” However, not everyone believed Chen was capable of such a ruse. “It’s too ridiculous to be true. What a mess it would be if there’s an additional 2 trillion yuan [of money supply],” one user wrote on Twitter-like Weibo. The largest note in China is 100 yuan, so 2 trillion yuan would be 20 billion notes, and would be worth about 2 per cent of China’s 2020 gross domestic product (GDP). It is not the first time the PBOC has been forced to deny rumours concerning its core operations. In March 2019, it rejected claims of a reserve requirement ratio cut, and then in August that year reported online rumours about an interest-rate cut to police. A 30-year-old man was detained two months later. Chinese authorities are on high alert to threats to economic and financial security, as growth stalls amid multiple headwinds, including widespread power shortages that have hurt industrial output, and high shipping costs and raw material prices have started to squeeze small producers. Fujian emergency drill sparks fears about Taiwan tensions China’s consumer price index grew 2.3 per cent year on year in November, its highest reading since September 2020, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Beijing has refused an all-out stimulus, though marginal easing is already in sight, especially as GDP growth dropped to 4.9 per cent in the third quarter of the year from 18.3 per cent in the first. The central bank lowered the one-year loan prime rate, a market benchmark, by 5 basis points on Monday and slashed the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points last week. However, the PBOC has limited room to continue easing because major central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, are ready to quit monetary stimulus and raise interest rates.

With no boundaries and a minimal amount required to invest in these digital assets, crypto-exchange platforms in India have surged over time, minting a huge population of investors. Drawn by celebrity advertising campaigns and simple, easy-to-use features introduced by various cryptocurrency exchanges such as WazirX, CoinSwitch Kuber, Binance and CoinDCX, many people have invested their money in these digital assets. By investing small amounts of their pocket money to earn maximum profits, these people have fuelled a surge in India’s cryptocurrency investments, which rose from just US$923 million in April last year to nearly US$6.6 billion in May this year. However, the official announcement of the Indian government’s proposed Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, which is aimed at regulating the cryptocurrency space, has left investors in a state of panic. The announcement resulted in people panic-selling their cryptocurrency investments, which led to a crash in the market. In the absence of government regulations, the cryptocurrency market could pose risks of virtual theft, financing terrorism, high volatility and tax evasion, among others. However, there is also discussion about whether the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has stood against the rise of private exchange platforms with its views that cryptocurrencies pose serious threats to the macroeconomic and financial stability of the country. Although the government has yet to make a decision on the banning of cryptocurrencies or private exchange platforms, it appears that the passage of India’s proposed legislation would mean that the RBI would be the regulator for cryptocurrencies, while cryptocurrency assets would be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. A complete ban on cryptocurrencies in India could hamper the progress of development and innovations that could be made through blockchain and other areas. There are many positive uses of cryptocurrencies that could help the country meet some of its pressing needs. While other countries around the world are embracing the promise of cryptocurrencies, with few of them moving to completely forbid their use, India is still waiting for a cryptocurrency bill that will be to the betterment of the state and its people.

Some analysts have called on Beijing to loosen purse strings further to finance infrastructure projects, as the country may have to defend a growth rate of 5 per cent in 2022. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) on Monday slashed the one-year loan prime rate (LPR), a weighted lending rate based on offers of 18 major banks and a de facto market benchmark, by 5 basis points to 3.8 per cent. However, the five-year LPR – which is linked to mortgage rates – remained unchanged at 4.65 per cent. The central bank also sold 10 billion yuan (US$1.5 billion) of seven-day reverse repos and 10 billion yuan of 14-day reverse repos – both of which are frequently used as liquidity injection tools – leaving both rates unchanged at 2.2 per cent and 2.35 per cent respectively. There should be no doubt by now that a serious, though still restrained, easing cycle is unfolding Wei Yao “There should be no doubt by now that a serious, though still restrained, easing cycle is unfolding,” Wei Yao, chief Asia economist at Societe Generale, wrote in a note. China bounced back strongly from the initial impact of the coronavirus in early 2020, but economic momentum has slowed in recent months amid multiple headwinds, including widespread power shortages that have hurt industrial output, and high shipping costs and raw material prices have started to squeeze small producers. The LPR adjustment followed a 50-basis-point cut to the reserve requirement ratio last Wednesday, which injected 1.2 trillion yuan of liquidity into the interbank system, and partial cut of the relending rate a week earlier. Wei called the LPR cut premature, attributing it to Beijing’s growing concerns over gross domestic product growth (GDP). China has the ‘tools’ to cope with economic challenges, says Li Keqiang “The measures taken so far – monetary, credit and fiscal – still do not seem enough for stabilising economic growth in coming months … Hence, we continue to expect more,” Wei said. New economic risks, including the Omicron variant, potential “spillover” from US tapering and slowing export growth due to US trade tensions, have forced China’s top leadership to emphasise stability next year. That means focusing on maintaining a reasonable GDP growth range, protecting market entities and the job market, stressing countercyclical measures, while front-loading policies and promoting appropriate project construction. Wang Jun, chief economist of Zhongyuan Bank, said authorities should consider slashing the medium-term lending facility (MLF), the main rate the PBOC lends to commercial banks, if economic activity slows further in the next quarter. We must seize this window of opportunity, as the Fed’s rate hike is only one or two quarters away Wang Jun “We must seize this window of opportunity, as the Fed’s rate hike is only one or two quarters away,” he said. The US central bank has accelerated tapering and could hike rates earlier than expected to stave off rising inflation. The Bank of England raised its benchmark policy rate by 15 basis points last week. Soochow Securities analyst Tao Chuan said Beijing’s choice to cut the LPR marked a further divergence in monetary policy from the US, and it could still slash the MLF or open market operations in the next quarter. “We are facing huge downward pressure in the first quarter of 2022, considering the high property sales and investment base last year and marginally deteriorating job market,” Tao said. “A 5-basis-point cut of LPR is not enough.” However, Ding Shuang, chief Greater China economist at Standard Chartered Bank, said higher consumer inflation and monetary tightening by major central banks did not warrant a cut of policy rates next year. “A rate cut is not the right response to the problem China is facing,” he said. “Fiscal policy is likely to do the heavy lifting, including ramping up and front-loading spending, with monetary and credit policies playing a supportive role.” According to calculations by Ding, this year’s national budget has been significantly under-utilised, including one trillion yuan earmarked for infrastructure investment in early 2022. Keeping the five-year LPR unchanged suggests a different approach toward the property sector and a preference for green and sustainable projects, analysts said. The Ministry of Finance has allocated 1.4 trillion yuan of next year’s special purpose bond quota to local authorities, with proceeds to be used in nine areas, including transport infrastructure, energy, logistics, affordable housing and environmental protection. “We’ll make sure the quota to be used to support the macroeconomy in the first quarter,” deputy minister Xu Hongcai told a media briefing last Thursday.",2021-12-20T23:00:31+08:00,2021-12-20T17:45:15+08:00,2021-12-21T00:27:37+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3160429/chinas-first-benchmark-rate-cut-20-months-signals-serious,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/20/57bd42fb-fda9-4b86-89b9-8d60dd4a3647_5108e5d9.jpg?itok=R9ekngo-&v=1639993518,China Economy

The world’s second-largest economy is poised to see its year-on-year growth rate drop below 4 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year, way down from a post-coronavirus peak of 18.3 per cent in the first quarter. Meanwhile, most market institutions have estimated that China needs to defend a growth bottom line of 5 per cent next year. Externally, the Fed said on Wednesday that it will double its reduction of monthly bond purchases from January, meaning that its rate hikes in the US could come earlier than expected against the backdrop of high inflation. The Bank of England got the ball rolling this week by becoming the world’s first major bank to raise interest rates since the onset of the pandemic, announcing a hike of 15 basis points – the first such rate hike in three years. Chen Yulu, deputy PBOC governor, said China should build all kinds of “firewalls” to guard against systemic financial risks, while also increasing the effectiveness of financial regulation, according to his article published in China Finance magazine on Friday. “It’s time to exercise China’s long-standing view of implementing monetary policies based on domestic needs,” said Wang Jun, chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank. “We must seize this window of opportunity, as the Fed’s rate hike is only one or two quarters away.” China aims to ‘deliver real results’ for key small firms with support upgrades Meanwhile, the central bank is expected to lower the loan prime rate, a market benchmark, on Monday. If announced, it would be the first cut since May 2020. It may also consider cutting the policy rate of medium-term lending facilities (MLFs) in the coming quarter. “Authorities have shifted their tone to credit expansion and encouraging state-owned banks to extend more loans,” Wang added. Beijing has turned more accommodative in supporting economic growth, and lending to the property sector – one of the most regulated areas this year – has partially eased. Mortgage loans rose by 53.2 billion yuan (US$8.35 billion) from October to 401.3 billion yuan last month. The PBOC already injected 1.2 trillion yuan worth of liquidity by cutting the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points on Wednesday, while rolling over 500 billion yuan worth of one-year MLFs. “A new easing cycle has started, and peak regulation is behind us,” Larry Hu, chief economist of Macquarie Capital, wrote in a note on Thursday.",2021-12-17T18:00:39+08:00,2021-12-17T18:00:32+08:00,2021-12-17T18:00:39+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3160139/china-needs-firewalls-guard-against-systemic-risks-economy,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/17/a23fa532-8feb-4cb8-9d32-2049ef0b7da5_24dd412d.jpg?itok=GuLjYa5B&v=1639735238,China Economy

Meanwhile, the world’s second-largest economy intends to implement a fast-track mechanism for Olympics-related demand, particularly for foreign visitors and athletes, according to official online statements. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) has deemed “stability” the top priority for 2022, matching the tone taken at last week’s central economic work conference . “[We will] improve the ‘macro-prudential’ and ‘micro-supervision’ framework in foreign exchange markets, prevent major risks, and safeguard national economic and financial security,” the regulator said during a meeting on Monday. China not rolling the dice on money outflows as Beijing extends battle lines Beijing had already been on high alert for unfavourable factors in its forex markets, while taking several steps to curb capital outflows as Washington tapers off the monetary stimulus that it has been providing for the US economy. There are concerns that the domestic economic slowdown and tensions with major Western countries could reduce China’s attractiveness to foreign investors and trigger outflows of hot money that entered China via a variety of channels in the past several years. A reversal of capital flows, which also occurred amid the United States’ last exit from quantitative easing, heaps considerable pressure on currency and can result in financial volatility. The US Federal Reserve is due to discuss an acceleration of its tapering and rate hikes during its two-day meeting beginning on Tuesday, as US inflation jumped to a 39-year high of 6.8 per cent in November. The People’s Bank of China said last week that it would raise the reserve requirement ratio for banks from 7 per cent to 9 per cent, effective Wednesday, after the yuan had appreciated to a three-year high of 6.3498 to the US dollar. “The move sent a clear message that authorities don’t want a fast yuan appreciation,” Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura, said at a media briefing on Monday. He added that the central bank should appropriately accelerate the settlement of forex, which has already accumulated to US$600 billion at commercial banks, to build up the country’s forex reserves, ease upward pressure on the yuan, and inject more liquidity into the domestic market. SAFE, which oversees the country’s US$3.2 trillion worth of forex reserves, a large proportion of which is in US-dollar-denominated assets, reiterated that it must ensure the safety, liquidity and value of forex assets. The Chinese government burned through about a quarter of its forex reserves, or nearly US$1 trillion, to defend the yuan’s exchange rate from 2015-17, as it was unprepared for the massive capital flight. [We must] strengthen the monitoring and early warning of cross-border capital flows, and severely crack down on violations … in the foreign exchange field State Administration of Foreign Exchange The yuan already began to weaken in the past two trading days, with the daily midpoint set at 6.3675 and the onshore rate reaching 6.3639 on Tuesday. The SAFE said that it will promote the opening of capital accounts in an orderly manner and will steadily expand the two-way opening of financial markets. It is also pushing market entities to stick with exchange rate neutrality, rather than a one-way bet, by encouraging more use of hedging tools. Meanwhile, the forex regulator will continue to crack down on capital outflows through grey areas such as underground banks, overseas casinos and cryptocurrency . “[We must] strengthen the monitoring and early warning of cross-border capital flows, and severely crack down on violations of laws and regulations in the foreign exchange field with a ‘zero tolerance’ attitude,” it said. China ups forex deposit reserve requirement ratio in bid to curb yuan rally On Tuesday, SAFE granted approval for the Bank of China, one of the country’s Big Four state-owned banks, to open up a foreign exchange “green channel” during the 2022 Winter Olympics. Beijing, which tries to project a positive image to the rest of the world, will simplify procedures for individual forex transactions and help foreign institutions open accounts during the sports gala. Meanwhile, it has vowed to make it more convenient for tourists to use mobile payment tools. This is in line with the central bank’s plan to let people use the digital yuan at the Winter Games , which take place from February 4-20, despite a diplomatic boycott by the US, Canada and Australia.",2021-12-14T22:15:21+08:00,2021-12-14T18:27:56+08:00,2021-12-14T23:56:38+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3159685/china-puts-forex-markets-under-microscope-yuan-rallies-and,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/14/f42a4197-6f70-4cd4-aa08-5afcf9f15e87_e759f3df.jpg?itok=1fKbXiZO&v=1639477683,China Economy
"China urged to ease economic policy, cut exposure to US assets ahead of impending Fed rate hike",‘Costs high’ if China is not ready for US rate hike,"['Prominent Chinese economist Yu Yongding says China must ‘prepare in advance’ for a US rate hike or face consequences', 'A US rate hike could strengthen the value of the US dollar against the yuan and trigger a fund outflow from China']",Frank Tang,"China should waste no time in diversifying from US dollar assets and easing its economic policy, according to analysts, as the world’s second largest economy is increasingly wary of its vulnerability to changes in US monetary policy. Yu Yongding, a prominent Chinese economist and former central bank adviser, said it was regretful that China’s own monetary policy is facing constraints as a result of monetary shifts in the United States and Europe. “If the US Federal Reserve raises rates, there are many measures available but it’s more difficult [to implement] in this environment and the costs will be high,” Yu said at a virtual seminar organised by Renmin University of China on Thursday. We need to prepare in advance. It’s difficult to predict when it will become a problem, but it may happen Yu Yongding “I regret to say that there are certain things we could have done earlier … If we continue to delay it, it will just get more difficult. “China’s monetary policy should support an expansion of fiscal policy to steady the economic growth. “We are competing with the US, from a geopolitical perspective, US’ [gross domestic product] growth may overtake China’s this year – this is a big problem that we should pay attention to.” Beijing urged to tap into policy tools as 2022 uncertainties loom The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said on Monday it will cut the reserve requirement ratio for major commercial banks by 0.5 percentage points, releasing 1.2 trillion yuan (US$188 billion) worth of long-term liquidity into the interbank system on December 15 to shore up the economy. But the Chinese central bank has previously been cautious about monetary easing, with officials saying monetary policy would remain prudent and downplaying the impact of developer Evergrande’s debt crisis. However, economic pressure has been mounting for China after its strong post-pandemic rebound in the first quarter of this year. China’s economy grew by 4.9 per cent in the third quarter of 2021 compared with a year earlier, down from the 7.9 per cent growth in the second quarter. Yu, who has said China should cut exposure to US Treasury bonds, also said persistent inflation would result in diminishing returns on Chinese investment in US government bonds. Tensions between the US and China have been rising since 2018, leading to calls from China’s circle of policymakers to limit exposure to the US dollar as Washington issues large amounts of US Treasury bonds to fund its deficits. China is currently the second largest foreign owner of US Treasury bonds, holding US$1.047 trillion worth of US government debt as of September, according to the latest data from the US Treasury. Following a buying spree that peaked in 2014, US Treasury bonds have remained a staple investment in China’s foreign exchange reserves, which totalled at US$3.222 trillion at the end of November. China’s yuan strengthens as trade surplus hits US$72 billion in November “We need to prepare in advance. It’s difficult to predict when it will become a problem, but it may happen,” Yu said. “In the short term, the US exiting its quantitative easing programme is unfavourable for China’s economy. In the long term, the impact will become more serious.” US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell has said the US needs to be ready to respond to the possibility that inflation may not recede in the second half of next year, fuelling expectations a rate hike could take place as soon as next June. Diverging monetary policy with the US could have many consequences for China, which is poised to expand support for the economy. A US rate hike could strengthen the value of the US dollar against other currencies, including the yuan, making borrowing in US dollars more costly for Chinese companies. More importantly, it could trigger a fund outflow from China, adding pressure on the value of the yuan, a primary concern for the Chinese government. In August 2015, after the US Federal Reserve began signalling a rate hike, the PBOC surprised markets by devaluing the yuan, leading to a mass capital exodus and a record fall in its foreign exchange reserves. “Right now, the crucial question is the yuan exchange rate [against the US dollar],” said Zhong Zhengsheng, chief economist at Ping An Securities, who was also a speaker at the virtual event yesterday. “If the Fed rate hike takes place in June next year, our monetary policy obviously should not be tight, but can we ease? “I think this decision depends on whether we should let the yuan exchange rate [against US dollar] move – allowing for significant depreciation and flexibility.” China’s central bank announced late on Thursday it will raise the reserve requirement ratio from 7 per cent to 9 per cent from Wednesday next week to curb the yuan’s rally against the US dollar. “With the US tightening monetary policy just when China is starting to ease, and the odds of more action in currency markets rising, the most likely trajectory for the yuan in the next several months is to depreciate both against the dollar and on a trade-weighted basis,” said Gavekal Economics in a note today. Analysts believe that China needs to accelerate monetary and fiscal policy expansion to support growth and reduce the negative impact from a potential US rate hike. “The inflow of funds [to Chinese securities] in 2020-21 set a historical record, causing concerns about future capital outflows. However, unlike in 2015, we face some favourable conditions,” said CICC Research in a note on Wednesday. “If monetary easing lags behind, then the easing may be understood as a confirmation that economic fundamentals are worse than expected, raising more challenges when it comes to management cross border capital flow,” CICC said. “From this perspective, the pace of monetary easing and stabilising credit should take place sooner rather than later.”",2021-12-11T02:00:18+08:00,2021-12-10T18:27:52+08:00,2021-12-11T03:29:06+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3159254/china-urged-ease-economic-policy-cut-exposure-us-assets-ahead,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/10/eecb451e-c191-4c18-b9d0-73eff4ccbcfc_917743cc.jpg?itok=WMu6wuzO&v=1639132078,China Economy
China’s yuan strengthens as trade surplus hits US$72 billion in November amid robust export growth,China’s yuan strengthens as trade surplus hits US$72 billion in November,"['China’s foreign reserves rose to US$3.222 trillion at the end of November, up US$4.8 billion from a month earlier', 'The dollar-denominated value of exports increased by 22 per cent on year last month, the second highest rise of 2021']",Amanda Lee,"China’s yuan strengthened against the US dollar on Wednesday, reaching its firmest level since May 2018, although analysts say depreciation risks are rising. In late session trading, the onshore yuan hit 6.3477 against the US dollar, gaining from 6.3515 in the morning session, while the offshore yuan traded at 6.3459 against the American currency. A lower yuan exchange rate figure means it takes fewer yuan to purchase one US dollar, indicating a stronger Chinese currency. Meanwhile, China’s foreign reserves rose to US$3.222 trillion at the end of November, up US$4.8 billion from a month earlier, according to data from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) on Tuesday. What does a stronger US dollar-yuan exchange rate mean? Trading in China’s foreign exchange market remained brisk and the flow of cross-border capital was largely stable last month, said Wang Chunying, deputy director and spokeswoman of the exchange regulator. “Under the combined effect of exchange rate conversion and asset price changes, the size of the foreign exchange reserves increased during the month,” Wang said. Analysts attributed the strength of the yuan and the growth of foreign reserves to China’s large trade surplus, which hit US$72 billion in November amid robust export growth this year. The dollar-denominated value of exports increased by 22 per cent year on year last month, the second highest monthly rise of 2021. “Northbound funds [flowing into China’s equity markets] continued to maintain a net inflow, with a total inflow of 18.49 billion yuan in November. This has supported the stability of China’s foreign exchange reserves,” said Wen Bin, chief analyst at China Minsheng Bank, in a note today. The outlook is still biased to the downside due to the slower growth outlook and Fed tightening Commerzbank China’s trade surplus could soon exceed US$600 billion, the highest level since 2015, analysts at Commerzbank said in a note on Wednesday. “The Chinese currency should benefit from the decent surplus for now,” said Commerzbank. “However, the outlook is still biased to the downside due to the slower growth outlook and Fed tightening.” In two days of testimony to US Congress last week, US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is open to doubling the pace of its asset purchasing taper to $30 billion from $15 billion. China’s export growth, the key driver of the economy this year, is expected to slow as many countries gradually resume normal supply chain operations following the easing of pandemic-related restrictions. “A strong dollar due to policy tightening is likely to be the main theme in the coming years, while China has much smaller room to manoeuvre which implies a downside risk for the Chinese currency,” Commerzbank said. In particular, divergent monetary policy between China, the US and other developing countries could introduce volatility in the yuan exchange rate, triggering fund outflows. As Beijing prefers the yuan to be trading within a stable range to cushion the blow from an economic slowdown, rising currency volatility would make it harder for China to strike a balance between growth, debt and leverage. Lu Lei, deputy head of SAFE, called for “more effective” monetary coordination with developed countries last week, while the PBOC said in its third quarter monetary policy report in November that it would adopt various measures, including making the yuan more flexible, to respond to Federal Reserve tapering. In contrast to the US, China is at the start of an easing cycle. The PBOC said on Monday it would cut the reserve requirement ratio for major commercial banks by 0.5 percentage points, releasing 1.2 trillion yuan worth of long-term liquidity into the interbank system on December 15, with an aim of supporting the Chinese economy in the face of growing headwinds. “It is also important to note China’s policy turn at a time when most major central banks, especially the Fed, will start tapering and, possibly, hike rates at a later stage,” Natixis said in a research note on Tuesday. “The divergence in monetary policies may entice portfolio outflows from China and thus revert the so-far strong performance of the [yuan].”",2021-12-08T18:45:14+08:00,2021-12-08T15:49:40+08:00,2021-12-08T18:45:14+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3158892/chinas-yuan-strengthens-trade-surplus-hits-us72-billion,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/08/e4e56973-363a-4f27-87a0-fc188a3a86bd_e7f34954.jpg?itok=TXnCk-Jp&v=1638949787,China Economy
China to cut reserve requirement ratio for second time this year to boost economic growth amid strong...,China to cut banks’ reserve requirement ratio again to boost economic growth,"['PBOC decision comes only three days after Premier Li Keqiang said China would cut the RRR ‘at an appropriate time’', 'Move comes amid signs that China’s economic growth is slowing, while a downturn in the property market appears imminent']",Orange Wang,"China’s central bank has announced its second reserve ratio cut this year to shore up the economy, as the nation’s leaders prioritise stability ahead of a key political meeting next year. The People’s Bank of China said on Monday that it will cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for major commercial banks by 0.5 percentage points, releasing 1.2 trillion yuan (US$188 billion) worth of long-term liquidity into the interbank system on December 15 with an aim of supporting the Chinese economy in the face of growing headwinds. The move comes amid signs that China’s economic growth is slowing, while a downturn in the property market is imminent as developer Evergrande Group’s debt restructuring could also trigger a tightening of the credit market. Ensuring economic and social stability has moved to the top of Beijing’s agenda in the lead-up to next year’s political gathering that will usher in a leadership reshuffle, and the central government has been signalling more policy easing. China on high alert for monetary policy changes from US and EU In a statement issued after its meeting on Monday, the Communist Party’s 25-member Politburo, China’s primary decision-making body chaired by President Xi Jinping, said the country will “put the word of stability as the top priority” in its economic decision-making for 2022. The statement also removed some optimistic wording that followed an economy-focused meeting in July, when the Politburo said “the economy continues to recover steadily, with a stable performance and good momentum for growth”. The omission came as Beijing has recently been sounding the alarm on “new downward pressure” on China’s economy. “[We should] continue to improve people’s livelihood, strive to stabilise the macroeconomy, keep the economy running within a reasonable range, maintain overall social stability, and welcome the successful convening of the 20th CPC National Congress,” Monday’s statement said, according to the Xinhua News Agency. The upcoming RRR cut by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will allow most banks to maintain a reduced average ratio of 8.4 per cent, while small banks that now have a lower reserve ratio of 5 per cent will be excluded. The announcement came only three days after Premier Li Keqiang said China would cut the RRR “at an appropriate time”, during a virtual meeting with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Friday. It marks the central bank’s second cut of the RRR this year . The first was announced in July, two days after the State Council said it was considering the possibility, and unleashed about 1 trillion yuan (US$157 billion) worth of liquidity into the economy. The reserve requirement ratio sets the minimum amount of reserves that must be held by banks and cannot be loaned out. When chairing a symposium with non-party members on Thursday, President Xi also called on the country to coordinate its pandemic control measures with its economic needs to ensure social stability ahead of the 20th party congress. “The 20th CPC National Congress will be held next year, and it is a major event in the political life of the party and the state. At present, the economic situation at home and abroad is still complicated,” Xi said at the symposium, according to Xinhua. China’s new generation of leaders will have to pass ‘the loyalty test’ The Politburo meeting also preceded an agenda-setting central economic work conference, which is set to take place from Wednesday to Friday to map out economic priorities for the coming year. However, specific targets such as the nation’s annual economic growth target will not be made public until a legislative gathering known as the “ two sessions ” next spring. In the lead-up to this week’s conference, there has been debate among economists and officials as to whether Chinese authorities should fortify the country’s infrastructure, and perhaps moderately loosen policy and ease up on cooling measures in the real estate sector. The statement following Monday’s Politburo meeting also omitted a previously used saying – “houses are for living in, not for speculation – referring to Beijing’s strong regulation of the sector. Instead, the statement emphasised the need to “promote the healthy development and virtuous circulation of the real estate industry”. The PBOC adheres to the normal monetary policy … and will not flood the economy with credit People’s Bank of China statement The PBOC said that the overall RRR cut was to fortify a “cross-cycle adjustment” of macroeconomic policies – a catchphrase that represents a long-term view to inject liquidity support into the economy in advance, to cope with potential challenges ahead. “[China’s] prudent monetary policy direction has not changed,” the PBOC said in a separate statement on the upcoming RRR cut, calling it “a regular action of monetary policy”. “The PBOC adheres to the normal monetary policy, maintains the continuity, stability and sustainability of the policy, and will not flood the economy with credit,” the statement said, adding that the PBOC will “create suitable monetary and financial conditions for high-quality development and supply-side structural reform”. The statement also noted that the RRR cut will increase the stable fund supply in the long run to support the real economy, will guide financial institutions to lend more to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and will bring down the overall financing cost in the country. China using ‘variety of tools’ to help ensure reasonable economic growth “[The PBOC] is coordinating this year’s macro policies with next year’s, to support SMEs, green development and technological innovation,” the central bank said. Zhong Zhengsheng, chief economist at Ping An Securities, expects more easing policies to come. “In due course, there is still a necessity to further ease the monetary policy, but the overall effect of interest rate cuts is relatively strong, and we still need to wait for the signals of increasing downward pressure on the economy,” Zhong said. Meanwhile, Capital Economics said the PBOC is trying to nudge banks to lower lending rates to help struggling firms. “But [it] doesn’t want to engineer a sharp pickup in the quantity of lending – the announcement reiterates the goal of keeping credit growth broadly in line with nominal GDP growth,” it said. And Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, predicted after the Politburo meeting on Monday that “the government may loosen policies in the property sector”. The Politburo called for expanding “effective investment” and boosting the continuous recovery of private consumption, as the leadership tries to rely more on enlarging domestic demand to drive future growth as part of China’s dual-circulation strategy . It also flagged the need to improve the core competitiveness of the country’s manufacturing sector to strengthen the resilience of the supply chain. And faced with a looming demographic crisis, the decision-makers also called for the implementation of “new birth policies”.",2021-12-06T17:45:26+08:00,2021-12-06T17:45:19+08:00,2021-12-06T21:16:46+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3158649/china-cut-reserve-requirement-ratio-second-time-year-boost,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/06/5a46c9d5-a678-440c-b6f3-11014759521f_af410258.jpg?itok=n7hGeduV&v=1638783925,China Economy
China calls for better international consultation over monetary policy to ensure ‘fairer’ international...,More evidence China on high alert for monetary policy changes from US and EU,"['Foreign exchange official Lu Lei says the spillover effect of policy changes from countries at the core of the global system warrant close attention', 'Comments to the International Finance Forum in Guangzhou are the latest sign that Beijing is on high alert for policy changes from the US Federal Reserve']",Frank Tang,"The Chinese authorities want “more effective” monetary coordination with developed countries to ensure a “fairer” international environment, a foreign exchange official said on Saturday. The warning from Lu Lei, deputy head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, is the latest evidence that Beijing is on high alert for a policy turnaround from the US Federal Reserve despite repeated assurances that it is well prepared. “Countries lying at the core of the international monetary system often have a big say,” he told the annual conference of the International Finance Forum in Guangzhou. “Spillover effects from their policies deserve our close attention.” Major economies, including the United States and the European Union, have resorted to unprecedented fiscal and monetary policies to fight the coronavirus pandemic, and these have already pushed up global inflation. US consumer inflation has stayed above 5 per cent for six straight months and it reached a three-decade high of 6.2 per cent in October . The German consumer price index hit the highest level since 1992 at 5.2 per cent in November. China says forex market foundations remain solid amid Fed monetary easing Market worries jumped as Fed chair Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee earlier this week that inflation would not be transitory and a quicker pace of tapering may be discussed in mid-December. Lu is the latest Chinese official to directly express concern about external challenges such as rising inflation, potential capital outflows and volatility in the yuan’s exchange rate. On Friday, Yi Gang, governor of the People’s Bank of China, and his predecessor Zhou Xiaochuan attended the virtual meeting of the Group of 30, an international body of academics and financiers, to discuss the impact of demand, supply chain disruption and structural factors on inflation. Beijing, after successfully containing the initial outbreak of the pandemic, chose not to have a large stimulus. The policy divergence with the West is likely to continue as it is going to become more accommodative next year to prevent an economic hard landing, compared with the US tendency for policy tightening to contain rising inflation. “Powell’s speech indicated the Fed will accelerate its tightening, and global liquidity may face a major test,” Lu warned. “Given the deep interconnection of financial markets, it could accelerate cross-border [risk] contagion.” Beijing and Washington have expressed their respective concerns over financial issues – the Fed is worried about the risk from Evergrande – but the two sides have not yet started formal discussions. However, both took part in discussions to agree a global minimum corporate tax rate under the G20 framework, as well as talks on debt relief and the use of the International Monetary Fund’s special drawing rights reserve. “We should make the monetary policy consultation mechanism more effective. Particularly, we should pay attention to the policy spillovers in major developed economies, to gain a fairer and just international environment for emerging markets and developing countries,” Lu said. China’s forex regulator has been warning against one-way market bets on the yuan since May, calling for exchange rate neutrality among enterprises. It recently took action to fight outflows through such channels such as underground banks and overseas casinos, and on Friday issued new regulations to standardise forex transactions. The International Finance Forum estimated global economic growth could slow to 4.7 per cent next year from 5.9 per cent this year, while downside risks include slower-than-expected vaccine roll-out and geopolitical tensions including those between China and the US. Meanwhile, it warned that higher and more persistent inflation could prompt abrupt monetary adjustments overseas, threatening emerging markets with capital outflows, currency market volatility and disruption of the recovery process, the forum said in a report. Chinese banks told to limit speculative trading as yuan surges “Developing economies should continue to strengthen their macroeconomic fundamentals and reduce vulnerability to external shocks, and use macroprudential policy tools in disposal to act when necessary,” it suggested.

Singapore’s central bank to weigh actions after DBS suffers massive glitch,Singapore to weigh actions after DBS suffers massive disruption,"['The disruptions in DBS’ digital services – an area where the Singapore-based bank has invested in heavily – started early on Tuesday and resurfaced the following day', 'Under the central bank’s regulations, financial institutions need to ensure that the maximum downtime for each critical system does not exceed 4 hours within any period of 12 months']",Bloomberg,"Singapore’s central bank on Wednesday said it would consider supervisory actions after DBS Group Holdings suffered one of the worst digital disruptions for Southeast Asia’s biggest lender in the past decade. “This is a serious disruption and MAS expects DBS to conduct a thorough investigation to identify the root causes and implement the necessary remedial measures,” Marcus Lim, assistant managing director at the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said in an emailed response to questions on Wednesday. “MAS will consider appropriate supervisory actions following the investigation.” The disruptions in DBS’ digital services – an area where the Singapore-based bank has invested in heavily – started early on Tuesday and resurfaced the following day. The problems stemmed from the bank’s access control servers, resulting in customers’ inability to log in to the services, country head Shee Tse Koon said in a video clip on its Facebook page. “We acknowledge the gravity of the situation and as we work to resolve matters, we seek your patience and understanding,” Shee said. He apologised to customers and reassured them that their deposits were safe, adding that banking services at all its branches had been extended by two hours. The central bank has been following up closely with DBS since the disruptions began, Lim said. MAS agreed with DBS that the priority was to restore services, he said, without commenting on what potential supervisory actions the authority might take. Central bank says no ‘significant funds’ from Myanmar firms in Singapore Under MAS’ regulations, financial institutions need to ensure that the maximum downtime for each critical system does not exceed four hours within any period of 12 months. In 2010, DBS set aside S$230 million (US$168 million) in regulatory capital after its banking services failed for more than six hours following repairs. DBS in recent years has invested heavily to digitise its core banking business and set up new technology platforms. Such efforts have helped to boost the bank’s return-on-equity and have enabled the lender to reach more customers in all of its markets. In a separate comment on Twitter, the Singapore-based bank debunked speculation that the disruption was linked to a bond sale by Myanmar’s shadow government set up by supporters of Aung San Suu Kyi, who was ousted by the army in a February coup. The National Unity Government raised US$9.5 million within 24 hours of the opening of the sale of its so-called spring revolution special bonds, Public Voice Television, a channel run by the group, reported Wednesday. The group plans to sell US$200 million worth bonds in the initial phase. Singapore has seen other disruptions. In 2018, rival Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp had a glitch that impacted its automated teller machines and online banking systems for several hours over a weekend. The outages come as DBS prepares to face new challengers with the arrival of more digital banks in the city state next year.

Crypto oversight agenda released by US banking regulators could require permission to offer digital currencies,Crypto oversight from US regulators could require permission for bank use,"['The Federal Reserve and other banking agencies are grappling with issues related to cryptocurrencies, including custody and crypto-backed loans', 'The agenda does not affect current regulations, but the agencies are seeking to clarify next year how banks’ use of crypto will be regulated']",Bloomberg,"US banking agencies provided more insight into their plans for regulating cryptocurrencies on Tuesday, issuing a to-do list of their priorities for next year and announcing a new policy that would require banks to seek permission before offering digital currency products. The Federal Reserve and other banking agencies released an agenda outlining areas of focus, including how they plan to weigh custody, crypto-backed loans and the possibility of capital standards, according to a joint statement. Separately, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said that banks must get an additional sign-off from the regulator before engaging with digital coins. “Throughout 2022, the agencies plan to provide greater clarity on whether certain activities related to crypto-assets conducted by banking organizations are legally permissible,” the Fed, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said in the statement. China cryptocurrency news sites suspended as Beijing crackdown continues While the agenda doesn’t affect any current regulations, the topics officials said they want to clarify next year could shape how the agencies ultimately regulate the way banks use crypto. Their “crypto-asset road map” overlaps with moves the OCC made in 2020 to open up banking to digital coins when Brian Brooks was in charge of the agency, though current Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu paused those efforts. After concluding what they called a “crypto sprint” to study how agencies were approaching crypto, the banking regulators settled on several areas they need to clarify. Those issues include how banks should properly maintain custody of crypto assets, what firms should do to help consumers make transactions, how stablecoins should be issued and what capital and liquidity standards should be for lenders’ crypto holdings. The OCC followed the release of the road map with a new policy on how banks should interpret its previous crypto directives. Hsu’s agency instructed the banks it regulates to seek pre-approval before they can manage custody of digital coins, hold deposited dollars to back stablecoins and handle crypto transactions tied to a distributed ledger, which is the technology underpinning the industry. Lenders will have to ask for special permission and demonstrate they have sufficient risk controls before the OCC will sign off, according to the agency. Following their 2022 road map and other recent recommendations, the OCC and other agencies could soon be weighing new rules for regulating tokens more like bank assets. The President’s Working Group on Financial Markets wants Congress to take up legislation requiring that stablecoins only be issued by regulated banks. The group of agency heads has also called for government overseers to assess whether tokens pose risks to the wider financial system. Still, it’s uncertain whether the three bank agencies will be able to agree on anything in the near term. The OCC is still awaiting the confirmation of a permanent leader, and the Biden administration hasn’t yet nominated a vice-chairman to run the Fed’s supervision work. Meanwhile, the FDIC is still run by a Trump administration appointee, Jelena McWilliams.",2021-11-24T11:19:35+08:00,2021-11-24T11:16:43+08:00,2021-11-24T11:19:35+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3157163/crypto-oversight-agenda-released-us-banking-regulators-could-require,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/24/adfac6e6-f190-4ff3-80f2-fcbdc4a5319a_fb4e5d8f.jpg?itok=KCZUuSnl&v=1637723806,Policy
US Federal Reserve must get creative and act fast to end inflation spiral,US Federal Reserve must raise interest rates before it is too late,,Stephen Roach,"The transitory inflation debate in the US is over. The upsurge in inflation has turned into something far worse than the Federal Reserve expected. It is presumed to have the wisdom and firepower to keep underlying inflation in check, but that remains to be seen. The Fed counsels patience. It is so convinced its forecast will turn out to be correct that it is content to wait. No surprise there – the Fed telegraphed such a response with its “ average inflation targeting ” framework last year. In doing so, the Fed indicated it was prepared to forgive above-target inflation to compensate for years of below-target inflation. Little did it know what it was getting into. In theory, average inflation targeting made sense – an arithmetic consistency of undershoots balanced by overshoots. In practice, it was an inherently backward-looking approach, conditioned by a long experience with slow growth and low inflation. Like many, the Fed believed the pandemic shock of early 2020 was similar to the 2008 global financial crisis, underscoring the possibility of another anaemic recovery that could push already-low inflation dangerously towards deflation. Ever since the dotcom bubble burst, Fed policymakers have worried about Japan-like stagnancy for the US economy with lost decades of economic stagnation and persistent deflation. Those concerns are understandable if a crisis hits when inflation is already close to zero. But, by fixating on such risks, the Fed all but ignored the possibility of major upside inflation. That is exactly what has happened. Thanks to an explosive post-lockdown rebound in aggregate demand, which the Fed played a key role in fuelling, already-stressed global supply chains snapped. Today’s price and cost pressures are too numerous to count. Transitory one-off price adjustments became pervasive, and a major inflation shock is at hand. But there is an added complication – the Fed’s belief in the powers of its balance sheet. Like average inflation targeting, quantitative easing was also born of recent crises. Ben Bernanke led the charge in detailing the list of unconventional policy options the monetary system has when the nominal policy rate nears zero. He first couched this in terms of a thought exercise in 2002, stressing the Fed’s capacity for liquidity injections via asset purchases should deflationary risks mount. But when reality came close to the hypothetical in 2009, Bernanke’s script became an action plan – as it did again during the Covid-19 shock of 2020. While out of basis points at the zero bound, the ever-creative Fed was never out of ammunition. The challenge comes with restoring monetary policy to pre-crisis settings. For both the conventional benchmark policy interest rate and the unconventional balance sheet, the US central bank has yet to figure this out. The Fed faces two complications. First, unwinding ultra-accommodative monetary policies is a delicate operation that raises the possibility of corrections in asset markets and the asset-dependent real economy. Next move for China’s interest rates should be up, not down Second, there is confusion over how long it takes to return policy to its pre-crisis settings. That is because, until now, there has never been an urgency to normalise. Persistently low inflation would give an inflation-targeting central bank leeway to feel its way down the road. Now the Fed must normalise in the face of an inflation shock . This calls into question the glacial process envisioned in a low-inflation normalisation scenario. The Fed has failed to make this distinction. It has telegraphed a mechanistic unwinding of the two-step approach it used during the crisis. The Fed views normalisation as a reverse operation – reining in its balance sheet first and then raising the policy rate. While that might be appropriate in a low-inflation environment, an inflation shock makes it unworkable. The preferred first step is likely to have only a limited impact on the real economy and inflation. The Fed needs to reassess its approach to policy sequencing. With inflationary pressures going from transitory to pervasive, the policy rate should be the first line of defence. The federal funds rate is at minus 6 per cent in inflation-adjusted terms, deeper in negative territory than in the mid-1970s. My advice: up the ante on creative thinking. With inflation surging, stop defending a bad forecast and forget about tinkering with the balance sheet. Get on with the heavy lifting of raising interest rates before it is too late. Independent central bankers can afford to ignore the political backlash. I only wish the rest of us could do the same. Stephen S.

"Cheap green loans funded by China’s central bank could accelerate clean, energy saving projects, analysts say",Chinese central bank’s cheap green loans may accelerate clean energy projects,"['People’s Bank of China is offering cheap funding to banks to subsidise their lending to green projects', 'Potential savings from lending facility may not be substantial, CICC analysts say']",Yujie Xue,"A new lending facility rolled out by China’s central bank to support carbon reduction could expand the country’s green finance sector and accelerate the development of green projects to support its decarbonisation targets, analysts said. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) , said on Monday that it was offering cheap funding to banks to subsidise their lending to green projects. The facility will allow national financial institutions such as commercial banks to apply for coverage of up to 60 per cent of loans made to qualifying green projects. “The launch of this tool provides cheaper funds for banks’ lending to carbon emission reduction projects, and could boost banks’ enthusiasm for funding this sector,” Hu Hongyu, analyst at Hwabao Securities, said in a note this week. The scale of loans, “especially in the fields of clean energy, energy saving, environmental protection and carbon emission reduction technologies”, will expand in the future, he added. China is the world’s biggest greenhouse gases emitter, at more than 10 billion tonnes a year. Its president, Xi Jinping, has set a target of peak emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. In September, he also announced that China would stop building new coal-fired power plants overseas. Moreover, on Monday, the PBOC directed financial institutions to focus on helping industries that are in the early stages of development but have huge potential in carbon emissions reduction, especially in the clean energy, energy saving, environmental protection and decarbonisation technologies sectors. Stocks of energy storage, photovoltaic and energy-saving sectors surged by more than 9 per cent the following day. Sustainable finance ‘talent war’ erupts in Hong Kong amid rise in regulatory demands, green products Under its new liquidity tool, the central bank will lend to banks at an interest rate of 1.75 per cent for one year. The banks can use these funds to lend to green projects at a higher rate, in line with China’s loan prime rates, which stands at 3.85 per cent for one year and 4.65 per cent for five years. Household distributed rooftop solar systems and wind and solar energy grid integration systems, two types of projects that recently received government approval and policy support, could also benefit from the PBOC lending facility in addition to wind and hydropower, according to Hwabao Securities’ Hu. Support facilities that require heavy asset inputs, such as smart grids, will also get a strong boost from the lending facility, he added. “The scope of the sectors eligible for support can also be adjusted according to industry development or policy needs,” Hu said. The potential savings in funding cost from the emission reduction supporting tool may, however, “not be substantial” analysts at brokerage China International Capital Corporation said in a report this week. “For now, it is difficult to precisely forecast the detailed implementation of the tool,” they added. The facility is equivalent to an interest-rate cut of 72 basis points in the funding cost of green loans, according to the report. To access the lending facility, banks will need to back up loans with collateral, provide the emissions reduction data tied to borrowers and disclose such statistics to the public, the PBOC said. After the China Banking Regulatory Commission issued the Green Credit Guidelines in 2012, which aim to encourage banking institutions to develop green credit services and to adopt stronger environmental and social risk management, China’s green credit market has grown year by year. The country’s green credit balance has grown from 5.2 trillion yuan (US$812.4 billion) at the end of 2013 to 13.9 trillion yuan as of June this year, making it the largest in the world, according to Hwabao Securities. Hong Kong can be Asia’s hub for green infrastructure financing needs, sustainability forum hears The PBOC did not reveal an estimate on the total liquidity injection through this new programme, but it was expected that it would add at least 1 trillion yuan in the coming year, according to Chinese securities firm Western Securities. “We see this as a significant step towards targeted easing to offset the downward pressure on growth in the short term, and [it will] also help achieve the longer term goal of decarbonisation,” Qu Hongbin, chief China economist and co-head of Asia economics research at HSBC, said in a report on Tuesday. “Combined with other anticipated targeted easing measures, this should help engineer a modest recovery in GDP growth in 2022,” he added.",2021-11-11T20:00:25+08:00,2021-11-11T19:49:13+08:00,2021-11-11T20:00:16+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3155733/cheap-green-loans-funded-chinas-central-bank-could-accelerate-clean-energy,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/11/11/bdab051e-42c0-11ec-b9bb-5bc84a21bb41_image_hires_200014.jpg?itok=__lE-emK&v=1636632023,Business

Commercial banks extended 826.2 billion yuan (US$129.3 billion) worth of new loans in October, an increase of 136.4 billion yuan (US$21.34 billion) from a year earlier, according to new data released by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) on Wednesday. Aggregate financing, an indicator that measures the country’s overall funding for the real economy, was 1.59 trillion yuan last month – an increase of 197 billion yuan from a year earlier. Alongside stable lending rates, the central bank also maintained liquidity in the market in support of potentially more issuances of special-purpose bonds, which are instruments used by local governments to raise funds, particularly for construction and projects. The bank’s latest data showed that, in October, local government bond issuance was 123.6 billion yuan higher than it had been a year prior – reaching 616.7 billion yuan. China to accelerate US$224 billion of local bond issuance to support slowing economy Meanwhile, the growth of M2, the broad measure of money supply, grew 8.7 per cent last month, 0.4 percentage points higher than a month earlier. “The growth of bank credit and aggregated financing has stabilised, with their monthly amount slightly higher than our expectations,” said Wen Bin, chief analyst at China Minsheng Bank. “The central bank is expected to use a variety of tools to ensure reasonably ample liquidity, while improving its structural monetary policies to help key areas and weak links and to ensure that growth occurs in a reasonable range.” Beijing has refused a Western-style stimulus to support its economy during the pandemic, not only because China recovered faster than others, but because it was already dealing with a national debt crisis that saw companies such as mega-developer Evergrande teetering on the brink of a collapse. But Beijing’s insistence on a tighter monetary approach, as well as more deleveraging, has raised concerns about the economy’s growth, which slowed to 4.9 per cent in the third quarter from 7.9 per cent in the second quarter . In a sign of a growing pivot on that policy, in the past two months, central regulators started to fine-tune the country’s property policies, including by convening meetings with property developers, implementing a soft loosening of mortgage loans for homebuyers, and offering development loans for qualified developers. Tang Jianwei, a senior economist with the Bank of Communications, said the household sector has felt the easing, but corporate credit demand remained weak and is a concern of policymakers. “We expected a gradual improvement of credit to both enterprises and households, because the central bank recently stressed the stability of credit growth and vowed to guide more commercial bank loans,” he said. China consumer inflation up amid food-supply concerns as factory-gate prices surge Economists also expect more loosening after the central bank it announced a new loan for qualified carbon reduction projects earlier this week. “The financial data showed that more economic-stabilisation policies could be in the pipeline,” Huatai Securities chief economist Yi Huan wrote in a research report this week. But chief China economist for Macquarie Capital, Larry Hu, warned that appetites for credit were already low and well-contained, especially with firms showing caution and using only short-term loans. Easing in property policies can afford to be more generous, he added. “Credit demand is now at the bottom of this down-cycle. Looking ahead, we expect credit growth to stabilise at the current level of 10-10.5 per cent,” he wrote in a note on Wednesday. “More monetary easing will come.”",2021-11-11T19:00:19+08:00,2021-11-11T18:58:59+08:00,2021-11-11T22:20:38+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3155723/chinas-central-bank-expected-use-variety-tools-ensure-ample,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/11/11/33576710-42d2-11ec-b9bb-5bc84a21bb41_image_hires_190029.jpg?itok=2UQxYVq1&v=1636628439,China Economy

China is a front-runner in the global race to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and is testing a digital yuan, or eCNY, in major cities including Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai, but has not set a timetable for its official roll-out.

China will also test the eCNY’s impact on its monetary policy and financial markets, he added.

US Fed warns China property sector stress could pose ‘risks’ to American economy,Fed warns China property sector stress could pose risk to US economy,"['Ongoing scrutiny by Beijing of corporate debt could stress highly indebted companies, spillover to financial firms, Fed says', 'Given size of its economy, stresses in China could strain global financial markets, US central bank says']",Chad Bray,"The US Federal Reserve warned in its semi-annual financial health check overnight that stress in China’s real estate sector could pose “some risks” to the American financial system, pointing to the recent concerns surrounding China Evergrande Group , the world’s most indebted property developer. In its latest Financial Stability Report , the US central bank said the ongoing regulatory scrutiny by Beijing over corporate debt levels has the potential to stress the property sector and other highly indebted businesses, which could lead to spillovers to financial firms, a sudden correction in real estate prices or a reduction in investor appetite in the mainland. “Given the size of China’s economy and financial system as well as its extensive trade linkages with the rest of the world, financial stresses in China could strain global financial markets through a deterioration of risk sentiment, pose risks to global economic growth, and affect the United States,” the Fed said. The statement came about two months after Fed chairman Jerome Powell downplayed the potential risk of contagion from Evergrande at a press conference, saying the Evergrande situation “seems very particular to China”. Evergrande, China’s biggest builder of homes, has struggled under the weight of 1.97 trillion yuan (US$308 billion) in total liabilities and missed several interest payments on its offshore debt in recent months, fuelling concerns about high debt levels in the property sector. The Shenzhen developer has managed to avoid defaulting on its debt by repaying some missed payments within a 30-day grace period, delivering a smaller amount of homes and repaying suppliers . However, other developers, such as Fantasia Holdings Group and Sinic Holdings Group , have defaulted on their debts in recent weeks, increasing investor uneasiness about a potential contagion. Even as concerns are growing, some investors are buying into Chinese property sector debt as it has sold off sharply in recent months. Goldman Sachs Asset Management, for example, has added a “modest amount of risk” through high-yield offshore bonds issued by Chinese property developers, with a portfolio manager saying the market has overestimated the contagion risk. China regulatory and property risks were cited as one of the top three risks to US financial stability over the next 12 to 18 months by market professionals surveyed by the Fed staff, outpaced only by persistent inflation and vaccine-resistant variants of Covid-19. The Fed conducted its survey of 26 market contacts between August and mid-October. Market participants also cited concerns about the potential escalation of US-China tensions as another risk that could destabilise markets, particularly surrounding Taiwan. The Fed separately warned that adverse developments in other emerging markets economies spurred by a sharp tightening in interest rates could also spill over to the US. “A sharp tightening of financial conditions, possibly triggered by a rise in bond yields in advanced economies or a deterioration in global risk sentiment, could push up debt servicing costs for EME [emerging market economy] sovereigns and businesses, trigger capital outflows, and stress EMEs’ financial systems,” the central bank said. “Widespread and persistent EME stresses could, in turn, have repercussions for the US financial system through its direct exposures to stressed EME businesses and sovereigns and through its indirect exposures via US businesses with strong links to EMEs.”",2021-11-09T11:56:05+08:00,2021-11-09T11:54:30+08:00,2021-11-09T22:54:12+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3155366/us-fed-warns-china-property-sector-stress-could-pose-risks,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/11/09/aea890de-4100-11ec-b9bb-5bc84a21bb41_image_hires_130911.jpg?itok=2tRi9q8s&v=1636434562,Banking & Finance

The Economic Daily on Monday reiterated that the services offered by online brokers such as Nasdaq-listed Futu Holdings and Tiger Brokers were “typical illegal financial activities” and operating without regulatory approval, echoing comments made late last month by a central bank official. Such financial activities were likely to become a tool for illegal capital outflows, and bear the risks of financial data leaking overseas, the newspaper said. “Futu has been operating within the original framework of industry laws and regulations, the same as other peers in Hong Kong with certificates,” US-listed Futu said in a reply to a query from the Post on Monday. Futu has been under strict regulatory scrutiny and has received certificates to operate in Hong Kong since its founding, it added. Tiger Brokers, which is also listed in New York, did not reply to a request for comment. Chinese state media started highlighting the risks posed by online brokers in mid-October, with the Communist Party mouthpiece the People’s Daily arguing that risks existed for online brokers such as Tencent Holdings-backed Futu and Xiaomi-backed Tiger Brokers in their protection of user data. That came as China was in the midst of a sweeping campaign to enhance protection of personal privacy , culminating in the implementation of the new personal information protection law on November 1. Tencent alumnus aims to turn Futu into China’s Charles Schwab The People’s Daily commentary was followed by an official at the People’s Bank of China saying on October 28 that online brokers need to be licensed in China to offer cross-border trades to mainland residents. The regulatory tightening has hit share prices of the companies hard, which soared during the coronavirus pandemic when investors flocked to online trading platforms. Futu has lost 70.4 per cent from its peak in mid-February, closing at US$56.49 on Friday. It had surged 247.2 per cent in the first quarter. Up Fintech Holding, parent of Tiger, has shed 81.5 per cent since touching a high on February 16. It closed at US$6.81 on Friday, after surging 124 per cent in the first quarter. The problem of personal information protection is more worrying, the Economic Daily said, adding regulators should strengthen collaboration to improve oversight of the sector. Futu had recorded a 230.2 per cent year on year jump in paying clients to one million in the second quarter, with net income rising 125.8 per cent to HK$533.9 million (US$68.7 million) from a year ago. Tiger reported a net loss of US$21.5 million in the second quarter compared with a net income of US$4.4 million in the same period in 2020. JPMorgan said a total clampdown on existing business of the online brokers was unlikely, according to its research report dated October 28. “Our sensitivity test shows that assuming revenue contribution from mainland clients goes to zero in 2022, Futu would still be profit-making,” analyst Katherine Lei said.",2021-11-08T14:06:18+08:00,2021-11-08T13:42:16+08:00,2021-11-08T22:59:54+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3155255/no-respite-futu-tiger-brokers-chinese-state-media-reiterate,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/11/08/7a8759ee-4046-11ec-b9bb-5bc84a21bb41_image_hires_140607.jpg?itok=nMiGhegV&v=1636351576,Companies
"A silent revolution is underway in Hong Kong’s fintech industry, helping city catch up to Greater Bay Area...",Will Greater Bay Area solidify Hong Kong’s role as a fintech hub?,"['From faster payments to Wealth Management Connect, Hong Kong has adopted a number of measures in recent years to bolster fintech bona fides', 'City’s banking apps lagged behind European counterparts in 2021 Mobile Banking Benchmark report']",Chad Bray,"As an international financial centre, Hong Kong has been surprisingly traditional when it comes to the local economy. Shopkeepers, crammed into wardrobe-size stores filled with ceiling-high stacks of clothing, hardware or toys, track their accounts in notebooks, often putting price stickers next to their sales records. Handwritten invoices are common, and cash remains king in Asia’s second-largest financial market. It is a different world 14 minutes away by high-speed train across the border in southern China’s technology metropolis Shenzhen . Cash is rarely used, and everything from dumplings to a luxury watch can be bought with the scan of a QR code on a smartphone. Still, Hong Kong is quietly catching up to Shenzhen, as the city aspires to become a fintech innovation hub for every application from day-to-day payments to the technology pipelines that carry trillions of dollars of capital freely across the world everyday, industry leaders and government officials said. “Hong Kong is a super connector and the most international city in China, playing a special role to connect the East and the West, and acting as the fusion reactor for fintech from the Greater Bay Area ,” AMTD Group’s chairman Calvin Choi said during the 2021 Hong Kong FinTech Week conference this week. A sign of the revolution underway: an electronic consumption voucher programme introduced in April to support battered retailers and restaurants added more than 3 million sign-ups to stored value facilities (SVF) in the city of 7.5 million residents. Grocers, taxi drivers and wet market vendors - among the most ardent holdouts against anything but cash - were among more than 80,000 merchants who began to accept electronic payments, according to Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po . As a result, paper notebooks are being replaced by QR codes and readers for the Octopus card, Hong Kong’s very own reusable SVF, launched in 1997. “[The voucher scheme] has helped promote the fintech industry and speed up the economic recovery of Hong Kong,” said Jim Lai, vice-president of Tencent Holdings and chairman of Tencent-backed Fusion Bank, one of eight virtual banks licenced in the city. Tencent’s WeChat Pay HK is one of the four e-wallets alongside the AlipayHK e-wallet by this newspaper’s owner, taking part in the e-voucher programme. Hong Kong has introduced a number of measures in the past three years to attract fintech start-ups as the city tried to keep pace with Silicon Valley, Singapore and Shenzhen in financial innovation. A landmark move was the 2018 launch of the Faster Payment System (FPS), which allows users to transfer money instantly to friends and family and selected merchants.  About 740,000 daily transactions worth more than HK$5.2 billion (US$668 million) were conducted via FPS as of September, more than Singapore’s Fast and Secure Transfers (FAST) system and the 24-year-old Octopus combined. Another sign of the changing times in the world’s most over- banked city - 165 licensed banks for 7.5 million residents - is the establishment of eight virtual banks. These financial institutions, which must operate entirely online without bricks-and-mortar physical branches, have attracted more than 1 million accounts between them since beginning operating in earnest last year. Last month, the city debuted Wealth Management Connect – the latest transborder investment channel for investors in mainland China and Hong Kong to dabble in each other’s markets – and announced a new one-stop sandbox to develop cross-border financial products. In a far reaching development, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is testing a digital yuan in the city, aiming to create more convenient payments between Hongkongers and mainland residents even as it fuels the prospect of launching the e-HKD, Hong Kong’s own central bank digital currency. Global cross-border payments may soar to US$156 trillion by 2022, with business-to-business transactions accounting for the bulk of those payments, according to EY’s report. Hong Kong, which maintains a fully convertible currency separate from the renminbi, can also serve as the springboard to help the Chinese government globalise the yuan by pushing for the e-yuan’s use in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. A digital currency platform prototype that links up multiple central banks called the “mBridge” is being tested, with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and the central bank of the United Arab Emirates being the latest entrants in February, alongside HKMA and the central bank of Thailand. The quartet are exploring the use of blockchain to smooth out cross-border fund transfers in capital market transactions, e-commerce, insurance payments, trade finance settlement and wealth management transactions. “Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre can contribute significantly to development of the mBridge platform,” said the HKMA’s financial infrastructure executive director Colin Pou, at the Fintech Week on Thursday. “Hong Kong would be a heavy user of this link, which would reinforce its status as an international financial centre.” Hong Kong is catching up in fintech as authorities push for the city’s integration into the Greater Bay Area (GBA), the cluster of 11 cities in southern China with more than 86 million residents and a combined economy of US$1.7 trillion. “We are very positive about the development of the GBA, and specifically on the role for Hong Kong, which will increasingly be important in terms of helping Chinese companies and customers to expand in overseas markets,” said BitRock Capital’s founding partner Alfred Shang. Supply chain finance is an area that could see some of the highest growth in the GBA in the coming years as the industry becomes more digitised, said Shang, a Hongkonger who lives in Shanghai. “With AI and blockchain, we will see more opportunities for financial services to catch up and [serve] these companies,” he said. “The funding gap for SMEs in China is about 20 trillion yuan (US$3.12 trillion) so there are a lot of opportunities in supply chain finance.” The digital revolution has transformed many of Hong Kong’s oldest banks. HSBC , which traces its root to the city in 1865, has seen an increase in digital usage in its trade finance business in the past two years, from about 50 per cent to the “mid-80s”, said the bank’s global commercial banking chief executive Barry O’Byrne. The biggest of Hong Kong’s three currency-issuing banks, HSBC spent US$5.5 billion last year on technology to digitise even more of its operations. About 85 per cent of its transactions in Hong Kong are done digitally and HSBC’s own PayMe payment application has attracted more than 2 million users since 2019, giving the bank the confidence to not pursue a virtual bank licence. Hong Kong’s proximity to China and its traditional role as the gateway to the mainland also makes it an attractive location for international start-ups, according to executives from the United Kingdom, northern Europe and South Korea. “The city is the top choice for Nordic start-ups in fintech and other sectors that want to expand their business in China and Asia,” said Binh Johansson, community director of Nordic Innovation House, which helps companies and start-ups develop in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and the US. “Hong Kong has a good pool of talents and English is widely spoken, which makes it easy for Nordic start-ups to operate here,” she added. “More importantly, the rest of the GBA is within close travel distance and Hong Kong is also close to other Asian markets by air.” Still, Hong Kong faces challenges in moving to the forefront of fintech. Mobile banking apps by traditional lenders and virtual banks scored 10 per cent lower than their European peers, according to Sia Partners’ 2021 Mobile Banking Benchmark report, an annual ranking of 114 mobile banking apps worldwide. None of Hong Kong’s banking apps made the study’s global top 15, while virtual banks in the United States, Japan and Europe scored 40 per cent higher on average than the city’s digital-only lenders. The gap “is still wide between the most innovative banks internationally and the most innovative ones in Hong Kong, and will remain for at least a couple of years,” said Etienne Ranwez, a manager in Hong Kong of the Paris-based consultancy Sia Partners. “We expect the gap to narrow in the coming years as Hong Kong’s virtual banks capitalise on lessons learned from their own operations and international best practices.” Singapore, with its own fintech festival beginning on Monday, is nipping at Hong Kong’s heels to attract start-ups. Hong Kong can compete, said Joseph Chan Ho-lim, the Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, citing the city’s top Asia spot and third global rank in the Global Financial Centres Index published in September. “Since many financial institutions set up their Asia’s regional headquarters in Hong Kong, this is the ideal place for the development of fintech as they can enjoy tremendous access to potential clients, investors and business partners,” Chan said. Hong Kong ranked ninth among cities globally, just ahead of Singapore, in research and analytics firm Findexable’s 2021 Global Fintech Rankings Report in June. Singapore wants to position itself as a key player for cryptocurrency and the underlying technology, the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s managing director Ravi Menon said on Bloomberg Television last week. “We are developing cryptocurrency technology, understanding blockchains , smart contracts and preparing ourselves, so if 2030 [becomes] a tokenised economy,” the central bank can answer the question of whether “Singapore is well-positioned,” Menon said. “But it is not without risk.” China, which had kept severe curbs on cryptocurrencies since 2017, made trading of the tokens outright illegal in September , after banning all mining activities four months earlier. Hong Kong has limited cryptocurrency transactions to professional investors, but the city’s financial regulator said on Wednesday it was reviewing those rules to potentially allow individual retail investors to own exchange traded funds (ETFs) with exposure to virtual assets. Hong Kong’s zero-Covid pursuit, including a quarantine period of up to 21 days, even for fully vaccinated inbound travellers, has raised the ire of international business executives. Nine out of 10 members surveyed by the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Asifma) said last month that they found it difficult to operate in the city because of its restrictive Covid-19 policies, with nearly half saying they were contemplating moving staff or functions away from the city as a result. Soon after the survey results were released, city officials said they were dropping most exemptions that had allowed senior business executives and foreign diplomatic personnel to skip weeks of isolation when travelling to the city. Hong Kong has pursued an aggressive policy to limit coronarvirus cases in hopes of spurring the reopening of the border with mainland China for quarantine-free travel, which could happen on a limited basis as soon as next month . The restrictive rules caused a number of northern European start-ups to abandon plans to attend the Hong Kong FinTech Week conference, said Johansson, the Nordic Innovation House community director. Johannson said the restrictive quarantine rules in Hong Kong, which require travellers to spend up to 21 days of quarantine, was a concern. “Many Nordic start-ups have shown a great interest in joining the Fintech Week in Hong Kong this year but decided not to as they found it hard to justify a 21-day quarantine for a two-day conference,” she said. Many Korean financial firms and start-ups are interested in opening operations in Hong Kong, but the quarantine measures are a concern, South Korea’s Consul General in Hong Kong Baek Yongchun. “We would like to see the restriction relaxed soon to [make it easier for] travellers to come to Hong Kong,” he said.

US tapering: China urged to make preparations for ‘spillover’ after Fed confirms tapering,China urged to prepare for ‘possible spillover’ from US tapering,"['The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it would start unwinding its pandemic stimulus, which could weaken China’s currency', 'Although the decision was well telegraphed, analysts say China should be prepared to ‘counter’ unexpected consequences']",Frank Tang,"China’s yuan appreciated slightly on Thursday, defying expectations it would weaken on imminent tapering from the US Federal Reserve, although Beijing has been warned to prepare for “possible spillover”. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell announced on Wednesday asset purchases would be scaled back by US$15 billion a month. Some analysts predict the tapering to be finished by June next year and it is likely to be followed by rate hikes. The US central bank’s move to unwind its massive pandemic stimulus is a key external uncertainty facing the world’s second largest economy, which could trigger capital outflows and weaken the Chinese currency. “The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement is well in line with market expectations, and the financial market is overall stable,” said Wen Bin, chief analyst of China Minsheng Bank. To counter possible spillover, China should maintain an independent monetary policy and make preparations with a more forward-looking approach Wen Bin “To counter possible spillover, China should maintain an independent monetary policy and make preparations with a more forward-looking approach. “The Chinese central bank may use a combination of policy tools, including reverse repo and medium-term lending facilities, to ensure a reasonably ample market liquidity, and use structural policy tools to guide the support for the real economy.” The People’s Bank of China set yuan midpoint at 6.3964 per US dollar on Thursday, stronger than the previous fixing of 6.4079. The onshore exchange rate traded stronger at 6.3958 in the spot market. The US dollar index, which has a negative correlation with the value of the yuan, dropped 0.2 per cent in the two previous trading days to 94 points, as the market factored in Powell‘s announcement. Zhou Hao, a senior emerging markets economist with Commerzbank, forecast the yuan to weaken to 6.6 per US dollar by year-end, as the taper unfolds. China cites ‘flexible’ yuan exchange rate, healthy economy as buffer against US tapering “The pressure on the yuan will persist next year because the US may raise its interest rate and the Chinese economy still faces downward pressure,” he said. Guan Tao, a former forex regulatory official and now chief economist at BOC International, said China should make contingency plans and deepen its tool kit to deal with abnormal fluctuations in the yuan exchange rate. “When the forex market encounters extreme conditions, we should step in at an appropriate time to prevent one-way market expectations,” he wrote in an article on Sina.com on Thursday. China’s commodities market has been hard hit since the announcement,  with the most   active crude oil futures contracts, delivered in December, falling 3.4 per cent to 510 yuan per tonne on Thursday. Rebar futures due to be delivered in January traded 3.3 per cent lower at 4,193 yuan per tonne. Beijing, which imposes stringent capital controls , has called the impact of US tapering controllable in an effort to anchor market confidence, saying its flexible yuan exchange rate to absorb the external shocks while stepping up its crack down on underground banks. Cheng Shi, chief economist of ICBC International, the investment bank arm of China’s largest state-owned bank, attributed market calmness to the Federal Reserve’s constant communication over its tapering path. However, he warned the US central bank had obviously misjudged a series of indicators including economic growth, inflation and labour market conditions this year. “Our review of the FOMC minutes in the past five years found the Fed actually didn’t endeavour to achieve the goals of inflation control or full employment,” he said in a research note. [The Federal Reserve’s] misjudgments may pose dangers to either the American economy or global markets Cheng Shi “It seems not prudent during the radical macroeconomic changes, and also neglects the long-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic on supplies. “Its misjudgments may pose dangers to either the American economy or global markets.” US inflation has stayed above 5 per cent for five straight months, including 5.4 per cent in September. China International Capital Corporation, a leading investment bank, also believes US inflation will last into the second half of next year, or even longer. “The supply restraints, from chip shortages, port congestion and labour shortages, are not as easy to solve as what Powell described,” it said.",2021-11-04T19:30:28+08:00,2021-11-04T19:30:20+08:00,2021-11-04T22:45:23+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3154886/us-tapering-china-urged-make-preparations-spillover-effects,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/11/04/428ea1ae-3d59-11ec-a1b3-e785d5c8830c_image_hires_193251.jpg?itok=j7pNwi3L&v=1636025581,China Economy
"Hong Kong, China, Thailand and UAE explore new uses of ‘mBridge’ digital currency project, including...",Multi-country central bank digital currency project explores new uses,"['The mBridge central bank digital currency project is exploring 15 potential uses, including settlement of cross-border securities', 'The project’s original scope was to help cut settlement time and costs associated with cross-border payments']",Georgina Lee,"A multi-country central bank digital currency project involving mainland China, Hong Kong, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates is looking at various options to expand its use, including capital market transactions, which could cut the settlement time for securities traded between them to a matter of seconds, top officials said. The possible uses for the “mBridge” digital currency platform is being expanded to 15, which now involves 22 private sector participants , top central bank officials from the participating states said during Hong Kong FinTech Week on Thursday. The project’s original scope involved building a common platform to help cut settlement time and costs associated with cross-border payments. Currently most currency transactions are settled on a “T+2” basis, or two days after a trade is concluded. But blockchain technology has enabled near real-time settlement by reducing the layers of middlemen involved in processing the transaction. The prototype has achieved good traction due to the strong political commitment from the four central banks, said Colin Pou, executive director of financial infrastructure at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. “Also, blockchain provides the right technological tool to tackle issues that we could not handle in the past,” he said. Apart from settling capital market transactions such as corporate bond issuance, the other potential applications include cross-border fund transfers linked to insurance transactions, e-commerce and wealth management products, according to the Bank of International Settlement Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, which is providing support for the mBridge project. The project is designed to target the pain points of the traditional correspondent bank arrangement, whereby processing fees for cross-border fund transfer for retail users can on average amount to as much as 7 per cent of a transaction’s value, according to the World Bank. With mBridge, that cost can cut by up to half, according to a report released by these four central banks in September. Maintaining a high level of user privacy will also be a priority, according to Mu Changchun, director general of the People’s Bank of China’s (PBOC) digital currency institute. “Based on its design, mBridge has a strong capability in privacy protection,” said Mu, adding that this could be achieved as transactions done on the platform will be decoupled from the end users’ identity. He also provided an update on China’s sovereign digital currency project. Since the roll-out of a pilot programme of the digital yuan or e-CNY in late 2019, digital yuan transactions have reached 62 billion yuan (US$9.7 billion), Mu said. About 1.6 million merchants across a wide range of businesses accept the “e-CNY” and it can also be used to pay for utility, transport and government services in many mainland cities. When the digital yuan was first mooted by the PBOC in 2014, it was originally designed for small value retail transactions only, he said. With PBOC joining the mBridge project in February this year, the potential use of the digital yuan has been expanded. Given the strong flow of trade between China, Hong Kong, Thailand and the UAE, which amounted to US$780 billion last year, the UAE sees a lot of relevance in mBridge, said Shu-Pui Li, an adviser to the UAE central bank governor. The UAE is the top exporter of oil to China, while the Middle East nation imports finished goods and food products from its partners. “The UAE buys resin from China, but the payment is made to Hong Kong [entities], not [entities] located in the mainland China. So we see a strong business case for [linking up with] the four jurisdictions,” he said.",2021-11-04T19:00:41+08:00,2021-11-04T18:57:02+08:00,2021-11-04T22:45:22+08:00,https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3154882/hong-kong-china-thailand-and-uae-explore-new-uses-mbridge,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/methode/2021/11/04/95769d7c-3d54-11ec-a1b3-e785d5c8830c_image_hires_190029.jpg?itok=FgAfRfTW&v=1636023639,Companies
